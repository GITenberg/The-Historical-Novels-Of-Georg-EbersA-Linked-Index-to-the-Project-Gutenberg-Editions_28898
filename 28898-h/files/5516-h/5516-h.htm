    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Deep silence brooded over the water and the green islands which rose like
      oases from its glittering surface. The palms, silver poplars, and
      sycamores on the largest one were already casting longer shadows as the
      slanting rays of the sun touched their dark crowns, while its glowing ball
      still poured a flood of golden radiance upon the bushes along the shore,
      and the light, feathery tufts at the tops of the papyrus reeds in the
      brackish water.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than one flock of large and small waterfowl flew past beneath the
      silvery cloudlets flecking the lofty azure vault of heaven; here and there
      a pelican or a pair of wild ducks plunged, with short calls which ceased
      abruptly, into the lush green thicket, but their cackling and quacking
      belonged to the voices of Nature, and, when heard, soon died away in the
      heights of the tipper air, or in the darkness of the underbrush that
      received the birds. Very few reached the little city of Tennis, which now,
      during the period of inundation in the year 274 B.C., was completely
      encircled by water.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the small island, separated from it by a channel scarcely three
      arrow-shots wide, it seemed as though sleep or paralysis had fallen upon
      the citizens of the busy little industrial town, for few people appeared
      in the streets, and the scanty number of porters and sailors who were
      working among the ships and boats in the little fleet performed their
      tasks noiselessly, exhausted by the heat and labour of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Columns of light smoke rose from many of the buildings, but the sunbeams
      prevented its ascent into the clear, still air, and forced it to spread
      over the roofs as if it, too, needed rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence also reigned in the little island diagonally opposite to the
      harbour. The Tennites called it the Owl&rsquo;s Nest, and, though for no
      especial reason, neither they nor the magistrates of King Ptolemy II ever
      stepped upon its shores. Indeed, a short time before, the latter had even
      been forbidden to concern themselves about the pursuits of its
      inhabitants; since, though for centuries it had belonged to a family of
      seafaring folk who were suspected of piracy, it had received, two
      generations ago, from Alexander the Great himself, the right of asylum,
      because its owner, in those days, had commanded a little fleet which
      proved extremely useful to the conqueror of the world in the siege of Gaza
      and during the expedition to Egypt. True, under the reign of Ptolemy I,
      the owners of the Owl&rsquo;s Nest were on the point of being deprived of this
      favour, because they were repeatedly accused of piracy in distant seas;
      but it had not been done. Yet for the past two years an investigation had
      threatened Satabus, the distinguished head of the family, and during this
      period he, with his ships and his sons, had avoided Tennis and the
      Egyptian coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house occupied by the islanders stood on the shore facing the little
      city. It had once been a stately building, but now every part of it seemed
      to be going to ruin except the central portion, which presented a less
      dilapidated appearance than the sorely damaged, utterly neglected side
      wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roof of the whole long structure had originally consisted of palm
      branches, upon which mud and turf had been piled; but this, too, was now
      in repair only on the central building. On the right and left wings the
      rain which often falls in the northeastern part of the Nile Delta, near
      the sea, had washed off the protecting earth, and the wind had borne it
      away as dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the house had been spacious enough to shelter a numerous family and
      to store a great quantity of goods and provisions, but it was now long
      since the ruinous chambers had been occupied. Smoke rose only from the
      opening in the roof of the main building, but its slender column showed
      from what a very scanty fire it ascended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose which this was to serve was readily discovered, for in front
      of the open door of the dwelling, that seemed far too large and on account
      of the pillars at the entrance, which supported a triangular pediment&mdash;also
      too stately for its sole occupant, sat an old woman, plucking three ducks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of her a girl, paying no heed to her companion, stood leaning
      against the trunk of the low, wide-branching sycamore tree near the shore.
      A narrow boat, now concealed from view by the dense growth of rushes, had
      brought her to the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful, motherless young creature, needing counsel, had come to old
      Tabus to appeal to her art of prophecy and, if she wanted them, to render
      her any little services; for the old dame on the island was closely bound
      to Ledscha, the daughter of one of the principal ship-owners in Tennis,
      and had once been even more closely united to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as the sun was about to set, the latter gave herself up to a wild
      tumult of sweet memories, anxious fears, and yearning expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until a cool breath from the neighbouring sea fanned her brow did she
      throw down the cord and implement with which she had been adding a few
      meshes to a net, and rising, gaze sometimes across the water at a large
      white house in the northern part of the city, sometimes at the little
      harbour or the vessels on the horizon steering toward Tennis, among which
      her keen eyes discovered a magnificent ship with bright-hued sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing a long breath, she enjoyed the coolness which precedes the
      departure of the daystar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the effect of this harbinger of night upon her surroundings was even
      more powerful than upon herself, for the sun in the western horizon
      scarcely began to sink slowly behind the papyrus thicket on the shore of
      the straight Tanite arm of the Nile, dug by human hands, than one new and
      strange phenomenon followed another.
    </p>
    <p>
      First a fan, composed of countless glowing rays which spread in dazzling
      radiance over the west, rose from the vanishing orb and for several
      minutes adorned the lofty dome of the deep-blue sky like the tail of a
      gigantic peacock. Then the glitter of the shining plumes paled. The
      light-giving body from which they emanated disappeared and, in its stead,
      a crimson mantle, with gold-bordered, crocus-yellow edges, spread itself
      over the space it had left until the gleaming tints merged into the deeper
      hues of the violet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl paid no heed to this splendid spectacle. Perhaps she noticed
      how the fading light diffused a delicate rose-hued veil over the
      light-blue sails, embroidered with silver vines, of the approaching state
      galley, making its gilded prow glitter more brightly, and saw one fishing
      boat after another move toward the harbour, but she gave the whole scene
      only a few careless glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha cared little for the poor fishermen of Tennis, and the glittering
      state galley could scarcely bring or bear away anything of importance to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The epistrategus of the whole province was daily expected. But of what
      consequence to the young girl were the changes which it was rumoured he
      intended to introduce into the government of the country, concerning which
      her father had expressed such bitter dissatisfaction before he set out on
      his last trip to Pontus?
    </p>
    <p>
      A very different matter occupied her thoughts, and as, pressing her hand
      upon her heart, she gazed at the little city, gleaming with crimson hues
      in the reflection of the setting sun, a strange, restless stir pervaded
      the former stillness of Nature. Pelicans and flamingoes, geese and ducks,
      storks and herons, ibises and cranes, bitterns and lapwings, flew in dark
      flocks of manifold forms from all directions. Countless multitudes of
      waterfowl darkened the air as they alighted upon the uninhabited islands,
      and with ear-splitting croaking and cackling, whistling and chirping,
      clapping and twittering, dropped into the sedges and bushes which
      concealed their nests, while in the city the doors of the houses opened,
      and men, women, and children, after toiling at the loom and in the
      workshop, came out to enjoy the coolness of the evening in the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fishing boat after another was already throwing a rope to the shore,
      as the ship with the gay sails approached the little roadstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      How large and magnificent it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the king&rsquo;s officials had ever used such a galley, not even the
      epistrategus of the Delta, who last year had given the banking and the oil
      trade to new lessees. Besides, the two transports that had followed the
      magnificent vessel appeared to belong to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha had watched the ships indifferently enough, but suddenly her gaze&mdash;and
      with it the austere beauty of her face&mdash;assumed a different
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her large black eyes dilated, and with passionate intentness she looked
      from the gaily ornamented galley to the shore, which several men in Greek
      costume were approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two had come from the large white house whose door, since
      sunset, had been the principal object of her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Hermon, the taller one, for whom she was waiting with old Tabus. He
      had promised to take her from the Owl&rsquo;s Nest, after nightfall, for a
      lonely row upon the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was not coming alone, but with his fellow-artist, the sculptor
      Myrtilus, the nomarch and the notary&mdash;she recognised both distinctly&mdash;Gorgias,
      the rich owner of the second largest weaving establishment in Tennis, and
      several slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flush crimsoned her face, now slightly tanned, to the brow, and
      her lips were compressed, giving her mouth an expression of repellent,
      almost cruel harshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the tension of her charming features, whose lines, though sharp, were
      delicately outlined, soon vanished. There was still plenty of time before
      the darkness would permit Hermon to join her unnoticed. A reception, from
      which he could not be absent, was evidently about to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was certainly the case; for now the magnificent galley had
      approached as near the land as the shallow water permitted, and the
      whistle of the rowers&rsquo; flute-player, shouts of command, and the barking of
      dogs could be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a handkerchief waved a greeting from the vessel to the men on shore,
      but the hand that held it was a woman&rsquo;s. Ledscha would have recognised it
      had the twilight been far deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The features of the new arrival could no longer be distinguished; but she
      must be young. An elderly woman would not have sprung so nimbly into the
      skiff that was to convey her to the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who assisted her in doing so was the same sculptor, Hermon, for
      whom she had watched with so much longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the blood mounted into Ledscha&rsquo;s cheeks, and when she saw the
      stranger lay her hand upon the shoulder of the Alexandrian who, only
      yesterday, had assured the young girl of his love with ardent vows, and
      allow him to lift her out of the boat, she buried her little white teeth
      deeply in her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never seen Hermon in the society of a woman of his own class, and,
      full of jealous displeasure; perceived with what zealous assiduity he who
      bowed before no one in Tennis, paid court to the stranger no less eagerly
      than did his friend Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole scene passed like a shadow in the dusk before Ledscha&rsquo;s eyes,
      half dimmed by uneasiness, perplexity, and suddenly inflamed jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptian twilight is short, and when Hermon disappeared with the
      new-comer it was no longer possible to recognise the man who entered the
      very boat in which she was to have taken the nocturnal voyage with her
      lover, and which was now rowed toward the Owl&rsquo;s Nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely it would bring her a message from Hermon; and as the stranger, who
      was now joined by a number of other women and two packs of barking dogs,
      with their keepers, vanished in the darkness, the skiff already touched
      the shore close at her side.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In spite of the surrounding gloom, Ledscha recognised the man who left the
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greeting he shouted told her that it was Hermon&rsquo;s slave, Pias, a
      Biamite, whom she had met in the house of some neighbours who were his
      relatives and had sharply rebuffed when he ventured to accost her more
      familiarly than was seemly for one in bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, in his childhood this man had lived near Tennis as the son of a free
      papyrus raiser, but when still a lad was sold into slavery in Alexandria
      with his father, who had been seized for taking part in an insurrection
      against the last king.

      In the service of Areluas, his present master&rsquo;s uncle, who had given him
      to his nephew, and as the slave of the impetuous yet anything but cruel
      sculptor, Hermon, he had become accustomed to bondage, but was still far
      more strongly attached to his Biamite race than to the Greek, to whom, it
      is true, his master belonged, but who had robbed him and his family of
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of forty did not lack mother wit, and as his hard fate rendered
      him thoughtful and often led him to use figurative turns of speech, which
      were by no means intended as jests, he had been called by his first master
      &ldquo;Bias&rdquo; for the sage of Priene.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house of Hermon, who associated with the best artists in
      Alexandria, he had picked up all sorts of knowledge and gladly welcomed
      instruction. His highest desire was to win esteem, and he often did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon prized the useful fellow highly. He had no secrets from him, and
      was sure of his silence and good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias had managed to lure many a young beauty in Alexandria, in whom the
      sculptor had seen a desirable model, to his studio, even under the most
      difficult circumstances; but he was vexed to find that his master had cast
      his eye upon the daughter of one of the most distinguished families among
      his own people. He knew, too, that the Biamites jealously guarded the
      honour of their women, and had represented to Hermon what a dangerous game
      he was playing when he began to offer vows of love to Ledscha.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was an extremely welcome task to be permitted to inform her that she
      was awaiting his master in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to her inquiry whether it was the aristocrat who had just arrived
      who kept Hermon from her, he admitted that she was right, but added that
      the gods were above even kings, and his master was obliged to yield to the
      Alexandrian&rsquo;s will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha laughed incredulously: &ldquo;He&mdash;obey a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly would not submit to a man,&rdquo; replied the slave. &ldquo;Artists, you
      must know, would rather oppose ten of the most powerful men than one weak
      woman, if she is only beautiful. As for the daughter of Archias&mdash;thereby
      hangs a tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archias?&rdquo; interrupted the girl. &ldquo;The rich Alexandrian who owns the great
      weaving house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is his daughter who is keeping Hermon? And you say he is obliged to
      serve her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As men serve the Deity, to the utmost, or truth,&rdquo; replied the slave
      importantly. &ldquo;Archias, the father, it is true, imposed upon us the debt
      which is most tardily paid, and which people, even in this country, call
      &lsquo;gratitude.&rsquo; We are under obligations to the old man&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
      denying it&mdash;and therefore also to his only child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; Ledscha indignantly exclaimed, and the dark eyebrows which met
      above her delicate nose contracted suspiciously. &ldquo;I must know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must!&rdquo; repeated the slave. &ldquo;That word is a ploughshare which suits only
      loose soil, and mine, now that my master is waiting for me, can not be
      tilled even by the sharpest. Another time! But if, meanwhile, you have any
      message for Hermon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she replied defiantly; but Bias, in a tone of the most eager
      assent, exclaimed: &ldquo;One friendly word, girl. You are the fairest among the
      daughters of the highest Biamite families, and probably the richest also,
      and therefore a thousand times too good to yield what adorns you to the
      Greek, that it may tickle the curiosity of the Alexandrian apes. There are
      more than enough women in the capital to serve that purpose. Trust the
      experience of a man not wholly devoid of wisdom, my girl. He will throw
      you aside like an empty wine bottle when he has used you for a model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Used?&rdquo; interrupted Ledscha disdainfully; but he repeated with firm
      decision: &ldquo;Yes, used! What could you learn of life, of art and artists,
      here in the weaver&rsquo;s nest in the midst of the waves? I know them. A
      sculptor needs beautiful women as a cobbler wants leather, and the charms
      he seeks in you he does not conceal from his friend Myrtilus, at least.
      They are your large almond-shaped eyes and your arms. They make him fairly
      wild with delight by their curves when, in drawing water, you hold the jug
      balanced on your head. Your slender arched foot, too, is a welcome morsel
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The darkness prevented Bias from seeing Ledscha&rsquo;s features, but it was
      easy to perceive what was passing in her mind as, hoarse with indignation,
      she gasped: &ldquo;How can I know the object of your accusations? but fie upon
      the servant who would alienate from his own kind master what his soul
      desires!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Bias changed not only his tone of voice, but his language, and,
      deeply offended, poured forth a torrent of wrath in the dialect of his
      people: &ldquo;If to guard you, and my master with you, from harm, my words had
      the power to put between you and Hermon the distance which separates
      yonder rising moon from Tennis, I would make them sound as loud as the
      lion&rsquo;s roar. Yet perhaps you would not understand them, for you go through
      life as though you were deaf and blind. Did you ever even ask yourself
      whether the Greek is not differently constituted from the sons of the
      Biamite sailors and fishermen, with whom you grew up, and to whom he is an
      abomination? Yet he is no more like them than poppy juice is like pure
      water. He and his companions turn life upside down. There is no more
      distinction between right and wrong in Alexandria than we here in the dark
      can make between blue and green. To me, the slave, who is already growing
      old, Hermon is a kind master. I know without your aid what I owe him, and
      serve him as loyally as any one; but where he threatens to lead to ruin
      the innocent daughter of the race whose blood flows in my veins as well as
      yours, and in doing so perhaps finally destroy himself too, conscience
      commands me to raise my voice as loud as the sentinel crane when danger
      threatens the flock. Beware, girl, I repeat! Keep your beauty, which is
      now to be degraded to feast the eyes of gaping Greeks, for the worthiest
      husband among our people. Though Hermon has vowed, I know not what, your
      love-dallying will very soon be over; we shall leave Tennis within the
      next few days. When he has gone there will be one more deceived Biamite
      who will call down the curse of the gods upon the head of a Greek. You are
      not the only one who will execrate the destiny that brought us here.
      Others have been caught in his net too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here?&rdquo; asked Ledscha in a hollow tone; and the slave eagerly answered:
      &ldquo;Where else? And that you may know the truth&mdash;among those who visited
      Hermon in his studio is your own young sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Taus? That child?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, stretching her hands toward
      the slave in horror, as if to ward off some impending disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That child, who, I think, has grown into a very charming girl&mdash;and,
      before her, pretty Gula, the wife of Paseth, who, like your father, is
      away on his ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, in a tone of triumphant confidence, the answer rang from the
      Biamite&rsquo;s lips: &ldquo;There the slanderer stands revealed! Now you are
      detected, now I perceive the meaning of your threat. Because, miserable
      slave, you cherish the mad hope of beguiling me yourself, you do your
      utmost to estrange me from your master. Gula, you say, visited Hermon in
      his studio, and it may be true. But though I have been at home only a
      short time, Tennis is too full of the praises of the heroic Greek who, at
      the risk of his own life, rescued a child from Paseth&rsquo;s burning house, for
      the tale not to reach my ears from ten or a dozen different quarters. Gula
      is the mother of the little girl whose life was saved by Hermon&rsquo;s bold
      deed, and perhaps the young mother only knocked at her benefactor&rsquo;s door
      to thank him; but you, base defamer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; Bias continued, maintaining his composure with difficulty, &ldquo;I saw
      Gula secretly glide into our rooms again and again to permit her child&rsquo;s
      preserver to imitate in clay what he considered beautiful. To seek your
      love, as you know, the slave forbade himself, although a man no more loses
      tender desires with his freedom than the tree which is encircled by a
      fence ceases to put forth buds and blossoms. Eros chooses the slave&rsquo;s
      heart also as the target for his arrows; but his aim at yours was better
      than at mine. Now I know how deeply he wounds, and so, as soon as yonder
      ship in the harbour bears our visitor away again, I shall see you,
      Schalit&rsquo;s daughter, Ledscha, standing before Hermon&rsquo;s modelling table and
      behold him scan your beauty to determine what seems worth copying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Biamite, panting for breath, had listened to the end. Then, raising
      her little clinched hand menacingly, she muttered through her set teeth:
      &ldquo;Let him try even to touch my veil with his fingers! If I had not been
      obliged to go away, this would not have happened to my Taus and luckless
      Gula.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely,&rdquo; replied Bias calmly. &ldquo;If the chicken runs into the water, the
      hen can not save it. For the rest&mdash;I grew up as a boy in freedom with
      the husband of your sister, who summoned you to her aid. His father&rsquo;s
      brick-kiln was next to our papyrus plantation. Then we fared like so many
      others&mdash;the great devour the small, the just cause is the lost one,
      and the gods are like men. My father, who drew the sword against
      oppression and violence, was robbed of liberty, and your brother-in-law,
      in payment for his honest courage, met an early death. Is the story which
      is told of you here true? I heard that soon after the poor fellow&rsquo;s burial
      the slaves in the brick-kiln refused to obey his widow. There were a dozen
      rebellious brick-moulders, and you&mdash;one can forgive you much for it&mdash;you,
      the weak girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not weak,&rdquo; interrupted Ledscha proudly. &ldquo;I could have taught three
      times twelve of the scoundrels who was master. Now they obey my sister,
      and yet I wish I had stayed in Tennis. Our Taus,&rdquo; she continued in a more
      gentle tone, &ldquo;is still so young, and our mother died when she was a little
      child; but I, fool, who should have warned her, left her alone, and if she
      yielded to Hermon&rsquo;s temptations the fault is mine, wholly mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this outburst the light of the fire, which old Tabus had fed with
      fresh straw and dry rushes, fell upon the face of the agitated girl. It
      revealed her thoughts plainly enough, and, pleased with the success of his
      warning, Bias exclaimed: &ldquo;And Ledscha, you, too, will not grant him that
      from which you would so gladly have withheld your sister. So I will go and
      tell my master that you refuse to give him another appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had confidently expected an assent, and therefore started indignantly
      at her exclamation: &ldquo;I intend to do just the contrary.&rdquo; Yet she eagerly
      added, as if in explanation: &ldquo;He must give me an account of himself, no
      matter where, and, since it can not be to-day, to-morrow at latest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slave, disappointed and anxious, now tried to make her understand how
      foolish and hard to accomplish her wish was, but she obstinately insisted
      upon having her own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias angrily turned his back upon her and, in the early light of the moon,
      walked toward the shore, but she hastened after him, seized his arm and,
      with imperious firmness, commanded: &ldquo;You will stay! I must first know
      whether Hermon really means to leave Tennis so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was his intention early this morning,&rdquo; replied the other, releasing
      himself from her grasp. &ldquo;What are we to do here longer, now that his work
      is as good as finished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when is he going?&rdquo; she urged with increased eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day after to-morrow,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;in five, or perhaps even in six
      days, just as it suits him. Usually we do not even know to-day what is to
      be done to-morrow. So long as the Alexandrian remains, he will scarcely
      leave her, or Myrtilus either. Probably she will take both hunting with
      her, for, though a kind, fair-minded woman, she loves the chase, and as
      both have finished their work, they probably will not be reluctant to go
      with Daphne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the boat as he spoke, but Ledscha again detained him,
      asking impatiently: &ldquo;And &lsquo;the work,&rsquo; as you call it? It was covered with a
      cloth when I visited the studio, but Hermon himself termed it the statue
      of a goddess. Yet what it represents&mdash;Does it look like my sister
      Taus&mdash;enough like her, I mean, to be recognised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A half-compassionate, half-mocking smile flitted over the Biamite&rsquo;s
      copper-coloured visage, and in a tone of patronizing instruction assumed
      by the better informed, he began: &ldquo;You are thinking of the face? Why no,
      child! What that requires can be found in the countenance of no Biamite,
      hardly even in yours, the fairest of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the goddess&rsquo;s figure?&rdquo; asked Ledscha eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that he first used as a model the fair-haired Heliodora, whom he
      summoned from Alexandria, and as the wild cat could endure the loneliness
      only a fortnight, the sisters Nico and Pagis came together. But Tennis was
      too quiet for them too. The rabble can only be contented among those of
      their own sort in the capital. But the great preliminary work was already
      finished before we left Alexandria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Gula&mdash;my sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were not used for the Demeter,&rdquo; said the slave, smiling. &ldquo;Just
      think, that slender scarcely grown creature, Taus, and the matronly
      patroness of marriage. And Gula? True, her little round face is fresh and
      not ill-looking&mdash;but the model of a goddess requires something more.
      That can only be obtained in Alexandria. What do not the women there do
      for the care of the body! They learn it in the Aphrodision, as the boys
      study reading and writing. But you! What do you here know even about
      colouring the eyelids and the lips, curling the hair, and treating the
      nails on the hands and feet? And the clothes! You let them hang just as
      you put them on, and my master&rsquo;s work is full of folds and little lines in
      the robe and the peplos&mdash;But I have staid too long already. Do you
      really insist upon meeting Hermon again?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will and must see him,&rdquo; she eagerly declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he answered harshly. &ldquo;But if you cast my warning to the
      winds, pity will also fly away with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not need it,&rdquo; the girl retorted in a contemptuous tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let Fate take its course,&rdquo; said the slave, shrugging his shoulders
      regretfully. &ldquo;My master shall learn what you wish. I shall remain at home
      until the market is empty. There are plenty of servants at your farm. Your
      messenger shall bring you Hermon&rsquo;s answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come myself and wait for it under the acacia,&rdquo; she cried hastily,
      and went toward the house, but this time it was Bias who called her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha reluctantly fulfilled his wish, but she soon regretted it, for
      though what he had to say was doubtless kindly meant, it contained a fresh
      and severe offence: the slave represented to her the possibility that, so
      long as the daughter of Archias remained his guest, Hermon might rebuff
      her like a troublesome beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if sure of her cause, she indignantly cut short his words: &ldquo;You
      measure him according to your own standard, and do not know what depends
      upon it for us. Remind him of the full moon on the coming night and,
      though ten Alexandrians detained him, he would escape from them to hear
      what I bring him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words Ledscha again turned her back upon him, but Bias, with a
      low imprecation, pushed the boat from the shore and rowed toward the city.
    </p>

      <a name="link2HCH0003" id="link2HCH0003">

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Ledscha heard the strokes of the oars she stopped again and, with
      glowing cheeks, gazed after the boat and the glimmering silver furrow
      which it left upon the calm surface of the moonlit water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart was heavy. The doubts of her lover&rsquo;s sincerity which the slave
      had awakened tortured her proud soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Hermon really only trifling mischievously with her affection?
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely it was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would rather endure everything, everything, than this torturing
      uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she was here on the Owl&rsquo;s Nest to seek the aid of old Tabus&rsquo;s magic
      arts. If any one could give her satisfaction, it was she and the demons
      who obeyed her will, and the old woman was glad to oblige Ledscha; she was
      bound to her by closer ties than most people in Tennis knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha had no cause to be ashamed of her frequent visits to the Owl&rsquo;s
      Nest, for old Tabus had no equal as a leech and a prophetess, and the
      corsair family, of which she was the female head, stood in high repute
      among the Biamites. People bore them no ill-will because they practised
      piracy; many of their race pursued the same calling, and the sailors made
      common cause with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha&rsquo;s father, too, was on good terms with the pirates, and when Abus,
      a handsome fellow who commanded his father&rsquo;s second ship and had won a
      certain degree of renown by many a bold deed, sought the hand of his
      oldest daughter, he did not refuse him, and only imposed the condition
      that when he had gained riches enough and made Ledscha his wife, he would
      cease his piratical pursuits and, in partnership with him, take goods and
      slaves from Pontus to the Syrian and Egyptian harbours, and grain and
      textiles from the Nile to the coasts of the Black Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Abus had yielded to this demand, since his grandmother on the Owl&rsquo;s
      Nest thought it wise to delay for a time the girl&rsquo;s marriage to him, the
      best beloved of her grandsons; she was then scarcely beyond childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Ledscha had felt a strong affection for the young pirate, in whom she
      saw the embodiment of heroic manhood. She accompanied him in imagination
      through all his perilous expeditions; but she had been permitted to enjoy
      his society only after long intervals for a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he remained absent longer than usual, and this very voyage was to
      have been his last on a pirate craft&mdash;the peaceful seafaring life was
      to begin, after his landing, with the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha had expected her lover&rsquo;s return with eager longing, but week after
      week elapsed, yet nothing was seen or heard of the ships owned by the
      Owl&rsquo;s Nest family; then a rumour spread that this time the corsairs were
      defeated in a battle with the Syrian war-galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first person who received sure tidings was old Tabus. Her grandson
      Hanno, who escaped with his life, at the bidding of his father Satabus,
      who revered his mother, had made his way to her amid great perils to
      convey the sorrowful news. Two of the best ships in the family had been
      sunk, and on one the brave Abus, Ledscha&rsquo;s betrothed husband, who
      commanded it, had lost his life; on the other the aged dame&rsquo;s oldest son
      and three of her grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabus fell as if struck by lightning when she heard the tidings, and since
      that time her tongue had lost its power of fluent speech, her ear its
      sharpness; but Ledscha did not leave her side, and saved her life by
      tireless, faithful nursing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Satabus, the old woman&rsquo;s second son, who now commanded the little
      pirate fleet, nor his sons, Hanno and Labaja, had been seen in the
      neighbourhood of Tennis since the disaster, but after Tabus had recovered
      sufficiently to provide for herself, Ledscha returned to Tennis to manage
      her father&rsquo;s great household and supply the mother&rsquo;s place to her younger
      sister, Taus.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not recovered the careless cheerfulness of earlier years, but,
      graver than the companions of her own age, she absented herself from the
      gaieties of the Biamite maidens. Meanwhile her beauty had increased
      wonderfully, and, attracting attention far and wide, drew many suitors
      from neighbouring towns to Tennis. Only a few, however, had made offers of
      marriage to her father; the beautiful girl&rsquo;s cold, repellent manner
      disheartened them. She herself desired nothing better; yet it secretly
      incensed her and pierced her soul with pain to see herself at twenty
      unwedded, while far less attractive companions of her own age had long
      been wives and mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arduous task which she had performed a short time before for her
      widowed sister had increased the seriousness of her disposition to sullen
      moroseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After her return home she often rowed to the Owl&rsquo;s Nest, for Ledscha felt
      bound to old Tabus, and, so far as lay in her power, under obligation to
      atone for the injury which the horror of her lover&rsquo;s sudden death had
      inflicted upon his grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she had at last been subjugated by a new passion&mdash;love for the
      Greek sculptor Hermon, who did his best to win the heart of the Biamite
      girl, whose austere, extremely singular beauty attracted his artist eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day Ledscha had come to the sorceress to learn from her what awaited
      her and her love. She had landed on the island, sure of favourable
      predictions, but now her hopes lay as if crushed by hailstones.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Bias, who was superior to an ordinary slave, was right, she was to be
      degraded to a toy and useful tool by the man who had already proved his
      pernicious power over other women of her race, even her own young sister,
      whom she had hitherto guarded with faithful care. It had by no means
      escaped her notice that the girl was concealing something from her, though
      she did not perceive the true cause of the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright moonbeams, which now wove a silvery web over every surrounding
      object, seemed like a mockery of her darkened soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the demons of the heights and depths had been subject to her, as to the
      aged enchantress she would have commanded them to cover the heavens with
      black clouds. Now they must show her what she had to hope or to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head slightly, as if she no longer believed in a favourable
      turn of affairs, pushed the little curls which had escaped from the wealth
      of her black hair back from her forehead with her slender hand, and walked
      firmly to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old dame was crouching beside the hearth in the middle room, turning
      the metal spit, on which she had put the ducks, over the freshly kindled
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smoke hurt her eyes, which were slightly inflamed, yet they seemed to
      serve their purpose better than her half-dulled ear, for, after a swift
      glance at Ledscha, she stammered in her faltering speech: &ldquo;What has
      happened? Nothing good, certainly. It is written on your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl nodded assent, pointed with a significant gesture to her eyes and
      the open air, and went down to the shore again to convince herself that no
      other vessel was approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she had to confide to Tabus was intended for her alone, and
      experience taught how far spoken words could be heard at night over the
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had returned to the hut, she bent down to the old woman&rsquo;s ear
      and, holding her curved hand to her lips, cried, &ldquo;He is not coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tabus shrugged her shoulders, and the smile of satisfaction which flitted
      over her brown, wrinkled face showed that the news was welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      For her murdered grandson&rsquo;s sake the girl&rsquo;s confession that she had given
      her heart to a Greek affected her painfully; but Tabus also had something
      else on her mind for her beautiful darling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she only intimated by a silent nod that she understood Ledscha, and
      her head remained constantly in motion as the latter continued: &ldquo;True, I
      shall see him again to-morrow, but when we part, it will hardly be in
      love. At any rate&mdash;do you hear, grandmother?&mdash;to-morrow must
      decide everything. Therefore&mdash;do you understand me?&mdash;you must
      question the cords now, to-night, for to-morrow evening what they advised
      might be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo; repeated Tabus in surprise, letting her gaze rest inquiringly upon
      the girl. Then she took the spit from the fire, exclaiming angrily:
      &ldquo;Directly, do you mean? As if that could be! As if the stars obeyed us
      mortals like maids or men servants! The moon must be at the full to learn
      the truth from the cords. Wait, child! What is life but waiting? Only have
      patience, girl! True, few know how to practise this art at your age, and
      it is alien to many all their lives. But the stars! From them, the least
      and the greatest, man can learn to go his way patiently, year by year.
      Always the same course and the same pace. No deviation even one hair&rsquo;s
      breadth, no swifter or slower movement for the unresting wanderers. No
      sudden wrath, no ardent desire, no weariness or aversion urges or delays
      them. How I love and honour them! They willingly submit to the great law
      until the end of all things. What they appoint for this hour is for it
      alone, not for the next one. Everything in the vast universe is connected
      with them. Whoever should delay their course a moment would make the earth
      reel. Night would become day, the rivers would return to their sources.
      People would walk on their heads instead of their feet, joy would be
      transformed to sorrow and power to servitude. Therefore, child, the full
      moon has a different effect from the waxing or waning one during the other
      twenty-nine nights of the month. To ask of one what belongs to another is
      to expect an answer from the foreigner who does not understand your
      language. How young you are, child, and how foolish! To question the cords
      for you in the moonlight now is to expect to gather grapes from thorns.
      Take my word for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she interrupted the words uttered with so much difficulty, and with
      her blackish-blue cotton dress wiped her perspiring face, strangely
      flushed by the exertion and the firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha had listened with increasing disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise old dame was doubtless right, yet before she ventured to the
      sculptor&rsquo;s workshop the next day she must know at every cost how matters
      stood, what she had to fear or to hope from him; so after a brief silence
      she ventured to ask the question, &ldquo;But are there only the stars and the
      cords which predict what fate holds in store for one who is so nearly
      allied to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, child, no,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But nothing can be clone about looking
      into the future now. It requires rigid fasting from early dawn, and I ate
      the dates you brought me. I inhaled the odor of the roasting ducks, too,
      and then&mdash;it must be done at midnight; and at midnight your people
      will be anxious if you are not at home by that time, or perhaps send a
      slave to seek you here at my house, and that&mdash;that must not be done&mdash;I
      must prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are expecting some one,&rdquo; Ledscha eagerly replied. &ldquo;And I know who
      it is. Your son Satabus, or one of your grandsons. Else why are the ducks
      cooked? And for what is the wine jar which I just took from its hiding
      place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vehement gesture of denial from Tabus contradicted the girl&rsquo;s
      conjecture; but directly after she scanned her with a keen, searching
      glance, and said: &ldquo;No, no. We have nothing to fear from you, surely. Poor
      Abus! Through him you will always belong to us. In spite of the Greek,
      ours you are and ours you will remain. The stars confirm it, and you have
      always been faithful to the old woman. You are shrewd and steadfast. You
      would have been the right mate for him who was also wise and firm. Poor,
      dear, brave boy! But why pity him? Because the salt waves now flow over
      him? Fools that we are! There is nothing better than death, for it is
      peace. And almost all of them have found it. Of nine sons and twenty
      grandsons, only three are left. The others are all calm after so much
      conflict and danger. How long ago it is since seven perished at once! The
      last three their turn will come too. How I envy them that best of
      blessings, only may they not also go before me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she lowered her voice, and in a scarcely audible whisper murmured:
      &ldquo;You shall know it. My son Satabus, with his brave boys Hanno and Labaja,
      are coming later in the evening. About midnight&mdash;if ye protect them,
      ye powers above&mdash;they will be with me. And you, child, I know your
      soul to its inmost depths. Before you would betray the last of Abus&rsquo;s
      kindred&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hand and tongue should wither!&rdquo; Ledscha passionately interrupted, and
      then, with zealous feminine solicitude, she asked whether the three ducks
      would suffice to satisfy the hunger of these strong men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman smiled and pointed to a pile of fresh leaves heaped one
      above another, beneath which lay several fine shad. They were not to be
      cooked until the expected visitors arrived, and she had plenty of bread
      besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the presence of these proofs of maternal solicitude the morose,
      wrinkled countenance of the old sorceress wore a kind, almost tender
      expression, and the light of joyous anticipation beamed upon her young
      guest from her red-rimmed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to see them once more!&rdquo; cried Tabus in an agitated tone. &ldquo;The last&mdash;and
      all three, all! If they&mdash;But no; they will not set to work so near
      Pelusium. No, no! They will not, lest they should spoil the meeting with
      the old woman. Oh, they are kind; no one knows how kind my rough Satabus
      can be. He would be your father now, girl, if we could have kept our Abus&mdash;he
      was the best of all&mdash;longer. It is fortunate that you are here, for
      they must see you, and it would have been hard for me to fetch the other
      things: the salt, the Indian pepper, and the jug of Pelusinian zythus,
      which Satabus is always so fond of drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Ledscha went into the ruinous left wing of the house, where she took
      from a covered hole in the floor what the old woman had kept for the last
      of her race, and she performed her task gladly and with rare skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next she prepared the fish and the pan, and while her hands were moving
      busily she earnestly entreated the old woman to gratify her wish and look
      into the future for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabus, however, persisted in her refusal, until Ledscha again called her
      &ldquo;grandmother,&rdquo; and entreated her, by the heads of the three beloved ones
      whom she expected, to fulfil her desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the old dame rose, and while the girl, panting for breath, took the
      roasted ducks from the spit, the former, with her own trembling hands,
      drew from the little chest which she kept concealed behind a heap of dry
      reeds, branches, and straw, a shining copper dish, tossed the gold coins
      which had been in it back into the box, and moistened the bottom with the
      blackish-red juice of the grape from the wine jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      After carefully making these preparations she called Ledscha and repeated
      that the cords possessed the power of prophecy only on nights when the
      moon was full, and that she would use another means of looking into the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she commanded the girl to let her hands rest now and to think of
      nothing except the questions whose answer she had at heart. Lastly, she
      muttered into the vessel a series of incantations, which Ledscha repeated
      after her, and gazed as if spellbound at the dark liquid which covered the
      bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, panting for breath, watched every movement of the sorceress, but
      some time elapsed ere the latter suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; and
      then, without removing her eyes from the bottom of the vessel, she went
      on, with faltering accents, as though she was describing a scene close
      before her eyes. &ldquo;Two young men-both Greeks, if the dress does not deceive&mdash;one
      is at your right hand, the other at your left. The former is fair-haired;
      the glance of his eyes is deep and constant. It is he, I think&mdash;But
      no! His image is fading, and you are turning your back upon him. You do it
      intentionally. No, no, you two are not destined for each other. You think
      of the one with the waving black hair and beard&mdash;of him alone. He is
      growing more and more distinct&mdash;a handsome man, and how his brow
      shines! Yet his glance&mdash;it sees more than that of many others, but,
      like the rest of his nature, it lacks steadfastness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she paused, raised her shaking head, looked at Ledscha&rsquo;s flushed
      face, and in a grave, warning tone, said: &ldquo;Many signs of happiness, but
      also many dark shadows and black spots. If he is the one, child, you must
      be on your guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; murmured the girl softly, as if speaking to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the deaf old crone had read the words from her lips, and while gazing
      intently at the wine, went on impatiently: &ldquo;If the picture would only grow
      more distinct! As it was, so it has remained. And now! The image of the
      fair man with the deep-blue eyes melts away entirely, and a gray cloud
      flutters between you and the other one with the black beard. If it would
      only scatter! But we shall never make any progress in this way. Now pay
      attention, girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words had an imperious tone, and with outstretched head and throbbing
      heart Ledscha awaited the old woman&rsquo;s further commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came at once and ordered her to confess, as freely and openly as
      though she was talking to herself, where she had met the man whom she
      loved, how he had succeeded in snaring her heart, and how he repaid her
      for the passion which he had awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      These commands were so confused and mingled in utterance that any one less
      familiar with the speaker would scarcely have comprehended what they
      required of her, but Ledscha understood and was ready to obey.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This reserved, thoroughly self-reliant creature would never have betrayed
      to any human being what moved her soul and filled it some times with
      inspiring hope, sometimes with a consuming desire for vengeance; but
      Ledscha did not shrink from confiding it to the demons who were to help
      her to regain her composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, obeying a swift impulse, she threw herself on her knees by the old
      woman&rsquo;s side. Then, supporting her head with her hands, she gazed at the
      still glimmering fire, and, as if one memory after another received new
      life from it, she began the difficult confession:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I returned from my sister&rsquo;s brick-kiln a fortnight ago,&rdquo; she commenced,
      while the sorceress leaned her deaf ear nearer to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During my absence something&mdash;I know not what it was&mdash;had
      saddened the cheerful spirits of my young sister Taus. At the recent
      festival of Astarte she regained them, and obtained some beautiful bright
      flowers to make wreaths for herself and me. So we joined the procession of
      the Tennis maidens and, as the fairest, they placed us directly behind the
      daughters of Hiram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we were about to go home after the sacrifice, two young Greeks
      approached us and greeted Hiram&rsquo;s daughters and my sister also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One was a quiet young man, with narrow shoulders and light, curling hair;
      the other towered above him in stature. His powerful figure was
      magnificently formed, and he carried his head with its splendid black
      beard proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the gods snatched Abus from me, though so many men had wooed me, I
      had cared for no one; but the fair-haired Greek with the sparkling light
      in his blue eyes and the faint flush on his cheeks pleased me, and his
      name, &lsquo;Myrtilus,&rsquo; fell upon my ear like music. I was glad when he joined
      me and asked, as simply as though he were merely inquiring the way, why he
      had never seen me, the loveliest among the beauties in the temple, in
      Tennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely noticed the other. Besides, he seemed to have eyes only for
      Taus and the daughters of Hiram. He played all sorts of pranks with them,
      and they laughed so heartily that, fearing the strangers, of whom there
      was no lack, might class them with the Hieroduli who followed the sailors
      and young men in the temple grottoes, I motioned to Taus to restrain
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hermon&mdash;this was the name of the tall, bearded man&mdash;noticed it
      and turned toward me. In doing so his eyes met mine, and it seemed as
      though sweet wine flowed through my veins, for I perceived that my
      appearance paralyzed his reckless tongue. Yet he did not accost me; but
      Myrtilus, the fair one, entreated me not to lessen for the beautiful
      children the pleasure to which we are all born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought this remark foolish&mdash;how much sorrow and how little
      pleasure I had experienced from childhood!&mdash;so I only shrugged my
      shoulders disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the black-bearded man asked if, young and beautiful as I was, I had
      forgotten to believe in mirth and joy. My reply was intended to tell him
      that, though this was not the case, I did not belong to those who spent
      their lives in loud laughing and extravagant jests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The answer was aimed at the black-bearded man&rsquo;s reckless conduct; but the
      fair-haired one parried the attack in his stead, and retorted that I
      seemed to misunderstand his friend. Pleasure belonged to a festival, as
      light belonged to the sun; but usually Hermon laboured earnestly, and only
      a short time before he had saved the little daughter of Gula, the sailor&rsquo;s
      wife, from a burning house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other did not let Myrtilus finish, but exclaimed that this would only
      confirm my opinion of him, for this very leap into the flames had afforded
      him the utmost joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The words fell from his bearded lips as if the affair was very simple, a
      mere matter of course, yet I knew that the bold deed had nearly cost him
      his life&mdash;I said to myself that no one but our Abus would have done
      it, and then I may have looked at him more kindly, for he cried out that
      I, too, understood how to smile, and would never cease doing so if I knew
      how it became me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he spoke he turned away from the girls to my side, while Myrtilus
      joined them. Hermon&rsquo;s handsome face had become grave and thoughtful, and
      when our eyes met I could have wished that they would never part again.
      But on account of the others I soon looked down at the ground and we
      walked on in this way, side by side, for some distance; but as he did not
      address a word to me, only sometimes gazed into my face as if seeking or
      examining, I grew vexed and asked him why he, who had just entertained the
      others gaily enough, had suddenly become so silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shook his head and answered&mdash;every word impressed itself firmly
      upon my memory: &lsquo;Because speech fails even the eloquent when confronted
      with a miracle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, except me and my beauty, could be meant by that? But he probably
      perceived how strangely his words confused me, for he suddenly seized my
      hand, pressing it so firmly that it hurt me, and while I tried to withdraw
      it he whispered, &lsquo;How the immortals must love you, that they lend you so
      large a share of their own divine beauty!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greek honey,&rdquo; interposed the sorceress, &ldquo;but strong enough to turn such a
      poor young head. And what more happened? The demons desire to hear all&mdash;all&mdash;down
      to the least detail&mdash;all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The least detail?&rdquo; repeated Ledscha reluctantly, gazing into vacancy as
      if seeking aid. Then, pressing her hand on her brow, she indignantly
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah, if I only knew myself how it conquered me so quickly! If I
      could understand and put it into intelligible words, I should need no
      stranger&rsquo;s counsel to regain my peace of mind. But as it is! I was driven
      by my anxiety from temple to temple, and now to you and your demons. I
      went from hour to hour as though in a burning fever. If I left the house
      firmly resolved to bethink myself and, as I had bidden my sister, avoid
      danger and the gossip of the people, my feet still led me only where he
      desired to meet me. Oh, and how well he understood how to flatter, to
      describe my beauty! Surely it was impossible not to believe in it and
      trust its power!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she hesitated, and while gazing silently into vacancy a sunny light
      flitted over her grave face, and, drawing a long breath, she began again:
      &ldquo;I could curse those days of weakness and ecstasy which now&mdash;at least
      I hope so&mdash;are over. Yet they were wonderfully beautiful, and never
      can I forget them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she again bowed her head silently, but the old dame nodded
      encouragingly, saying eagerly; &ldquo;Well, well! I understand all that, and I
      shall learn what more is coming, for whatever appears in the mirror of the
      wine is infallible&mdash;but it must become still more distinct. Let me&mdash;first
      conjure up the seventy-seven great and the seven hundred and seventy-seven
      little demons. They will do their duty, if you open your heart to us
      without reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This demand sounded urgent enough, and Ledscha pressed her head against
      the old woman&rsquo;s shoulder as if seeking assistance, exclaiming: &ldquo;I can not&mdash;no,
      I can not! As if the spirits who obey you did not know already what had
      happened and will happen in the future! Let them search the depths of my
      soul. There they will see, with their own eyes, what I should never, never
      succeed in describing. I could not tell even you, grandmother, for who
      among the Biamites ever found such lofty, heart-bewitching words as
      Hermon? And what looks, what language he had at command, when he desired
      to put an end to my jealous complaints! Could I still be angry with him,
      when he confessed that there were other beauties here whom he admired, and
      then gazed deep into my eyes and said that when I appeared they all
      vanished like the stars at sunrise? Then every reproach was forgotten, and
      resentment was transformed into doubly ardent longing. This, however, by
      no means escaped his keen glance, which detects everything, and so he
      urged me with touching, ardent entreaties to go with him to his studio,
      though but for one poor, brief hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you granted his wish?&rdquo; Tabus anxiously interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered frankly, &ldquo;but it was the evening of the day before
      yesterday&mdash;that was the only time. Secrecy&mdash;nothing, Grand
      mother, was more hateful to me from childhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he,&rdquo; the old woman again interrupted, &ldquo;he&mdash;I know it&mdash;he
      praised it to you as the noblest virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silent nod from Ledscha confirmed this conjecture, and she added
      hesitatingly: &ldquo;&lsquo;Only far from the haunts of men,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when the light
      had vanished, did we hear the nightingale trill in the dark thickets.
      Those are his own words, and though it angers you, Grandmother, they are
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until the secrecy is over, and the sun shines upon misery,&rdquo; the sorceress
      answered in her faltering speech, with menacing severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And beneath the tempter&rsquo;s roof you enjoyed the lauded secret love until
      the cock roused you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ledscha firmly. &ldquo;Did I ever tell you a lie, that you look at
      me so incredulously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incredulously?&rdquo; replied the old woman in protest. &ldquo;I only trembled at the
      danger into which you plunged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There could be no greater peril,&rdquo; the girl admitted. &ldquo;I foresaw it
      clearly enough, and yet&mdash;this is the most terrible part of it&mdash;yet
      my feet moved as if obeying a will of their own, instead of mine, and when
      I crossed his threshold, resistance was silenced, for I was received like
      a princess. The lofty, spacious apartment was brilliantly illuminated, and
      the door was garlanded with flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was magnificent! Then, in a manner as respectful as if welcoming an
      illustrious guest, he invited me to take my place opposite to him, that he
      might form a goddess after my model. This was the highest flattery of all,
      and I willingly assumed the position he directed, but he looked at me from
      every side, with sparkling eyes, and asked me to let down my hair and
      remove the veil from the back of my head. Then&mdash;need I assure you of
      it?&mdash;my blood boiled with righteous indignation; but instead of being
      ashamed of the outrage, he raised his hand to my head and pulled the veil.
      Resentment and wrath suddenly flamed in my soul, and before he could
      detain me I had left the room. In spite of his representations and
      entreaties, I did not enter it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; asked the sorceress in perplexity, &ldquo;you once more obeyed his
      summons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday also I could not help it,&rdquo; Ledscha answered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; cried Tabus indignantly, but the girl exclaimed, in a tone of
      sincere shame: &ldquo;You do well to call me that. Perhaps I deserve still
      harsher names, for, in spite of the sternness with which I forbade him
      ever to remind me of the studio by even a single word, I soon listened to
      him willingly when he besought me, if I really loved him, not to refuse
      what would make him happy. If I allowed him to model my figure, his renown
      and greatness would be secured. And how clearly he made me understand
      this! I could not help believing it, and at last promised that, in spite
      of my father and the women of Tennis, I would grant all, all, and
      accompany him again to the work room if he would have patience until the
      night of the next day but one, when the moon would be at the full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he?&rdquo; asked Tabus anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called the brief hours which I required him to wait an eternity,&rdquo;
       replied the girl, &ldquo;and they seemed no less long to me&mdash;but neither
      entreaties nor urgency availed; what you predicted for me from the cords
      last year strengthened my courage. I should wantonly throw away&mdash;I
      constantly reminded myself&mdash;whatever great good fortune Fate destined
      for me if I yielded to my longing and took prematurely what was already so
      close at hand; for&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;at that time it was
      promised that on a night when the moon was at the full a new period of the
      utmost happiness would begin for me. And now&mdash;unless everything
      deceives me&mdash;now it awaits me. Whether it will come with the full
      moon of to-morrow night, or the next, or the following one, your spirits
      alone can know; but yesterday was surely too soon to expect the new
      happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he?&rdquo; asked the old dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly did not make it easy for me,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but as I
      remained firm, he was obliged to yield. I granted only his earnest desire
      to see me again this evening. I fancy I can still hear him exclaim, with
      loving impetuosity, that he hated every day and every night which kept him
      from me. And now? Now? For another&rsquo;s sake he lets me wait for him in vain,
      and if his slave does not lie, this is only the beginning of his infamous,
      treacherous game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had uttered the last words in a hoarse cry, but Tabus answered
      soothingly: &ldquo;Hush, child, hush! The first thing is to see clearly, if I am
      to interpret correctly what is shown me here. The demons are to be fully
      informed they have required it. But you? Did you come to hear whether the
      spirits still intend to keep the promise they made then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha eagerly assented to this question, and the old woman continued
      urgently: &ldquo;Then tell me first what suddenly incenses you so violently
      against the man whom you have so highly praised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl related what had formerly been rumoured in Tennis, and which she
      had just heard from the slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lured other women&mdash;even her innocent young sister&mdash;to his
      studio. Now he wanted to induce Ledscha to go there, not from love, but
      merely to model her limbs so far as he considered them useful for his
      work. He was in haste to do so because he intended to return to the
      capital immediately. Whether he meant to leave her in the lurch after
      using her for his selfish purposes, she also desired to learn from the
      sorceress. But she would ask him that question herself to-morrow. Woe
      betide him if the spirits recognised in him the deceiver she now believed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Tabus had listened quietly, but when she closed her passionate
      threats with the exclamation that he also deserved punishment for
      alienating Gula, the sailor&rsquo;s wife, from her absent husband, the
      enchantress also lost her composure and cried out angrily: &ldquo;If that is
      true, if the Greek really committed that crime&mdash;then certainly. The
      foreigners destroy, with their laughing levity, much that is good among
      us. We must endure it; but whoever broke the Biamite&rsquo;s marriage bond, from
      the earliest times, forfeited his life, and so, the gods be thanked, it
      has remained. This very last year the fisherman Phabis killed with a
      hammer the Alexandrian clerk who had stolen into his house, and drowned
      his faithless wife. But your lover&mdash;though you should weep for sorrow
      till your eyes are red&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would denounce the traitor, if he made himself worthy of death,&rdquo;
       Ledscha passionately interrupted, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;What portion of the
      slave&rsquo;s charge is true will appear at once&mdash;and if it proves correct,
      to morrow&rsquo;s full moon shall indeed bring me the greatest bliss; for
      though, when I was younger and happier, I contradicted Abus when he
      declared that one thing surpassed even the raptures of love&mdash;satisfied
      vengeance&mdash;now I would agree with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud cry of &ldquo;Right! right!&rdquo; from the old crone&rsquo;s lips expressed the
      gray-haired Biamite&rsquo;s pleasure in this worthy daughter of her race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she again gazed at the wine in the vessel, and this time she did so
      silently, as if spellbound by the mirror on its bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, raising her aged head, she said in a tone of the most sincere
      compassion: &ldquo;Poor child! Yes, you would be cruelly and shamefully
      deceived. Tear your love for this man from your heart, like poisonous
      hemlock. But the full moon which is to bring you great happiness is
      scarcely the next, perhaps not even the one which follows it, but surely
      and certainly a later one will rise, by whose light the utmost bliss
      awaits you. True, I see it come from another man than the Greek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had listened with panting breath. She believed as firmly in the
      infallibility of the knowledge which the witch received from the demons
      who obeyed her as she did in her own existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All her happiness, all that had filled her joyous soul with freshly
      awakened hopes, now lay shattered at her feet, and sobbing aloud she threw
      herself down beside the old woman and buried her beautiful face in her
      lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Completely overwhelmed by the great misfortune which had come upon her,
      without thinking of the vengeance which had just made her hold her head so
      proudly erect, or the rare delight which a later full moon was to bring,
      she remained motionless, while the old woman, who loved her and who
      remembered an hour in the distant past when she herself had been dissolved
      in tears at the prediction of another prophetess, laid her trembling hand
      upon her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the child weep her fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, perhaps vengeance also, cured many a heartache, and when they had
      accomplished this office upon the girl who had once been betrothed to her
      grandson, perhaps the full moon bringing happiness, whose appearance first
      the cords, then the wine mirror in the bottom of the vessel had predicted,
      would come to Ledscha, and she believed she knew at whose side the girl
      could regain what she had twice lost&mdash;satisfaction for the young
      heart that yearned for love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only wait, wait,&rdquo; she cried at last, repeating the consoling words again
      and again, till Ledscha raised her tear-stained face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impulse urged her to kiss the sufferer, but as she bent over the mourner
      the copper dish slipped from her knees and fell rattling on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha started up in terror, and at the same moment the Alexandrian&rsquo;s
      packs of hounds on the shore opposite to the Owl&rsquo;s Nest began to bark so
      loudly that the deaf old woman heard the baying as if it came from a great
      distance; but the girl ran out into the open air and, returning at the end
      of a few minutes, called joyously to the sorceress from the threshold,
      &ldquo;They are coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They, they,&rdquo; faltered Tabus, hurriedly pushing her disordered gray hair
      under the veil on the back of her head, while exclaiming, scarcely able to
      use her voice in her joyous excitement: &ldquo;I knew it. He keeps his word. My
      Satabus is coming. The ducks, the bread, the fish, girl! Good, loyal
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a wide, long shadow fell across the dimly lighted room, and from the
      darkened threshold a strangely deep, gasping peal of laughter rang from a
      man&rsquo;s broad breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satabus! My boy!&rdquo; the witch&rsquo;s shriek rose above the peculiar sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; answered the gray-bearded lips of the pirate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one short moment he remained standing at the door with outstretched
      arms. Then he took a step toward the beloved being from whom he had been
      separated more than two years, and suddenly throwing himself down before
      her, while his huge lower limbs covered part of the floor, he stretched
      his hands toward the little crooked old woman, who had not strength to
      rise from her crouching posture, and seizing her with loving impetuosity,
      lifted her as if she were a child, and placing her on his knees, drew her
      into a close embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabus willingly submitted to this act of violence, and passing her thin
      left arm around her son&rsquo;s bull neck with her free hand, patted his bearded
      cheeks, wrinkled brow, and bushy, almost white hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      No intelligible words passed the lips of either the mother or the son at
      this meeting; nothing but a confused medley of tender and uncouth natural
      sounds, which no language knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet they understood each other, and Ledscha, who had moved silently aside,
      also comprehended that these low laughs, moans, cries, and stammers were
      the expressions of love of two deeply agitated hearts, and for a moment an
      emotion of envy seized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gods had early bereft her of her mother, while this savage fighter
      against the might of the waves, justice, law, and their pitiless, too
      powerful defenders, this man, already on the verge of age, still possessed
      his, and sunned his rude heart in her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before the old pirate had satisfied his yearning for
      affection and placed his light burden down beside the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabus now regained the power to utter distinct words, and, difficult as it
      was for her half paralyzed tongue to speak, she poured a flood of tender
      pet names and affectionate thanks upon the head of her rude son, the last
      one left, who had grown gray in bloody warfare; but with the eyes of her
      soul she again saw in him the little boy whom, with warm maternal love,
      she had once pressed to her breast and cradled in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, in his rough fashion, he warmly returned her professions of
      tenderness, her eyes grew wet with tears, and at the question what he
      could still find in her, a withered, good-for-nothing little creature who
      just dragged along from one day to another, an object of pity to herself,
      he again burst into his mighty laugh, and his deep voice shouted: &ldquo;Do you
      want to know that? But where would be the lime that holds us on the ships
      if you were no longer here? The best capture wouldn&rsquo;t be worth a drachm if
      we could not say, &lsquo;Hurrah! how pleased the old mother will be when she
      hears it!&rsquo; And when things go badly, when men have been wounded or
      perished in the sea, we should despair of our lives if we did not know
      that whatever troubles our hearts the old mother feels, too, and we shall
      always get from her the kind words needed to press on again. And then,
      when the strait is sore and life is at stake, whence would come the
      courage to cast the die if we did not know that you are with us day and
      night, and will send your spirits to help us if the need is great?
      Hundreds of times they rushed to our aid just at the right time, and
      assisted us to hew off the hand of the foe which was already choking us.
      But that is only something extra, which we could do without, if necessary.
      That you are here, that a man still has his dear mother, whose heart
      wishes us everything good and our foes death and destruction, whose aged
      eyes will weep if anything harms us, that, mother dear, that is the main
      thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent his clumsy figure over her as he spoke, and cautiously, as if he
      were afraid of doing her some injury, kissed her head with tender care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, rising, he turned to Ledscha, whom he always regarded as his dead
      son&rsquo;s betrothed bride, and greeted her with sincere kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her great beauty strengthened his plan of uniting her to his oldest son,
      and when the latter entered the house he cast a searching glance at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was favourable, for a smile of satisfaction flitted over his
      scarred features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young pirate&rsquo;s stately figure was not inferior in height to the old
      one&rsquo;s, but his shoulders were narrower, his features less broad and full,
      and his hair and beard had the glossy raven hue of the blackbird&rsquo;s
      plumage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man paused on the threshold in embarrassment, and gazed at
      Ledscha with pleased surprise. When he saw her last his grandmother had
      not been stricken by paralysis, and the girl was the promised wife of his
      older brother, to whom custom forbade him to raise his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had thought of her numberless times as the most desirable of women. Now
      nothing prevented his wooing her, and finding her far more beautiful than
      memory had showed her, strengthened his intention of winning her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This purpose had matured in the utmost secrecy. He had concealed it even
      from his father and his brother Labaja, who was still keeping watch on the
      ships, for he had a reserved disposition, and though obliged to obey his
      father, wherever it was possible he pursued his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Satabus shared Hanno&rsquo;s wish, it vexed him that at this meeting,
      after so long a separation, his son should neglect his beloved and
      honoured mother for the sake of a beautiful girl. So, turning his back on
      Ledscha, he seized the young giant&rsquo;s shoulder with a powerful grip to drag
      him toward the old woman; but Hanno perceived his error, and now, in brief
      but affectionate words, showed his grandmother that he, too, rejoiced at
      seeing her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sorceress gazed at her grandson&rsquo;s stalwart figure with a pleasant
      smile, and, after welcoming him, exclaimed to Ledscha: &ldquo;It seems as if
      Abus had risen from the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl vouchsafed her dead lover&rsquo;s brother a brief glance, and, while
      pouring oil upon the fish in the pan, answered carelessly: &ldquo;He is a little
      like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only in person,&rdquo; remarked the old pirate, with fatherly pride, and
      pointing to the broad scar across the young man&rsquo;s forehead, visible even
      in the dim light, he added by way of explanation: &ldquo;When we took vengeance
      for Abus, he bore away that decoration of honour. The blow nearly made him
      follow his brother, but the youth first sent the souls of half a dozen
      enemies to greet him in the nether world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Ledscha held out her hand to Hanno, and permitted him to detain it
      till an ardent glance from his black eyes met hers, and she withdrew it
      blushing. As she did so she said to Tabus: &ldquo;You can put them on the fire,
      and there stands whatever else you need. I must go home now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In taking leave of the men she asked if she could hope to find them here
      again the next day. &ldquo;The full moon will make it damnably light,&rdquo; replied
      the father, &ldquo;but they will scarcely venture to assail the right of asylum,
      and the ships anchored according to regulation at Tanis, with a cargo of
      wood from Sinope. Besides, for two years people have believed that we have
      abandoned these waters, and the guards think that if we should return, the
      last time to choose would be these bright nights. Still, I should not like
      to decide anything positively about the morrow until news came from
      Labaja.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find me, whatever happens,&rdquo; Hanno declared after his father had
      ceased speaking. Old Tabus exchanged a swift glance with her son, and
      Satabus said: &ldquo;He is his own master. If I am obliged to go&mdash;which may
      happen&mdash;then, my girl, you must be content with the youth. Besides,
      you are better suited to him than to the graybeard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands with Ledscha as he spoke, and Hanno accompanied her to her
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he was silent, but as she was stepping into the skiff he repeated
      his promise of meeting her here the following night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she answered quickly. &ldquo;Perhaps I may have a commission to
      give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will fulfil it,&rdquo; he answered firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;unless something unexpected prevents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when seated on the thwart she again turned to him, and asked: &ldquo;Does it
      need a long time to bring your ship, with brave men on board, to this
      place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can be here in four hours, and with favourable winds still sooner,&rdquo;
       was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if it displeases your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even then, and though the gods, many as there are, should forbid&mdash;if
      only your gratitude will be gained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will,&rdquo; she answered firmly, and the water plashed lightly under the
      strokes of her oars.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the extreme northern portion of the little city of Tennis a large,
      perfectly plain whitewashed building stood on an open, grass-grown square.
    </p>
    <p>
      The side facing the north rested upon a solid substructure of hard blocks
      of hewn stone washed by the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This protecting wall extended along both sides of the long, plain edifice,
      and prevented the water from overflowing the open space which belonged to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archias, the owner of the largest weaving establishment in Tennis, the
      father of the Alexandrian aristocrat who had arrived the evening before,
      was the owner of the house, as well as of the broad plain on which he had
      had it built, with the indestructible sea wall, to serve as a storehouse
      to receive the supplies of linen, flax, and wool which were manufactured
      in his factories.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was favourably situated for this purpose, for the raw materials could
      be moved from the ships which brought them to Tennis directly into the
      building. But as the factories were at a considerable distance, the
      transportation required much time and expense, and therefore Archias had
      had a canal dug connecting the workshops with the water, and at its end
      erected a new storehouse, which rendered a second transportation of the
      ships&rsquo; cargoes unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white mansion had not yet been devoted to any other purpose when the
      owner determined to offer the spacious empty rooms of the ware house to
      his nephews, the sculptors Hermon and Myrtilus, for the production of two
      works with whose completion he associated expectations of good fortune
      both for the young artists, who were his nephews and wards, and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very extensive building which now contained the studios and spacious
      living apartments for the sculptors and their slaves would also have
      afforded ample room for his daughter and her attendants, but Daphne had
      learned from the reports of the artists that rats, mice, and other
      disagreeable vermin shared the former storehouse with them, so she had
      preferred to have tents pitched in the large open space which belonged it.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, the broad field was exposed to the burning sun, and its soil was
      covered only with sand and pitiably scorched turf, but three palm trees, a
      few sunt acacias, two carob trees, a small clump of fig trees, and the
      superb, wide-branched sycamore on the extreme outer edge had won for it
      the proud name of a &ldquo;garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now a great change in its favour had taken place, for Daphne&rsquo;s beautiful
      tent, with walls and top of blue and white striped sail-cloth, and the
      small adjoining tents of the same colours, gave it a brighter aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very roomy main tent contained the splendidly furnished sitting and
      dining rooms. The beds occupied by Daphne and her companion, Chrysilla,
      had been placed in an adjoining one, which was nearly as large, and the
      cook, with his assistants, was quartered in a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head keeper, the master of the hounds, and most of the slaves remained
      in the transports which had followed the state galley. Some had slept
      under the open sky beside the dog kennel hastily erected for Daphne&rsquo;s pack
      of hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on the morning after the wholly unexpected arrival of the owner&rsquo;s
      daughter, the &ldquo;garden&rdquo; in front of the white house, but yesterday a
      desolate field, resembled an encampment, whose busy life was varied and
      noisy enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slaves and freedmen had been astir before sunrise, for Daphne was up
      betimes in order to begin the hunt in the early hour when the birds left
      their secret nooks on the islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cousins, the young sculptors, to please her, had gone out, too, but
      the sport did not last long; for when the market place of Tennis, just
      between the morning and noontide hours, was most crowded, the little boats
      which the hunters had used again touched the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      With them and Daphne&rsquo;s servants seafaring men also left the boats&mdash;Biamite
      fishermen and boatmen, who knew the breeding places and nests of the
      feathered prey&mdash;and before them, barking loudly and shaking their
      dripping bodies, the young huntress&rsquo;s brown and white spotted dogs ran
      toward the tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark-skinned slaves carried the game, which had been tied in bunches while
      in the boats, to the white house, where they laid three rows of large
      water fowl, upon the steps leading to the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne&rsquo;s arrows were supposed to have killed all these, but the master of
      the hunt had taken care to place among his mistress&rsquo;s booty some of the
      largest pelicans and vultures which had been shot by the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before retiring to her tent, she inspected the result of the shooting
      expedition and was satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been told of the numbers of birds in this archipelago, but the
      quantity of game which had been killed far exceeded her greatest
      expectations, and her pleasant blue eyes sparkled with joy as she began to
      examine the birds which had been slaughtered in so short a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, ere she had finished the task, a slight shadow flitted over her
      well-formed and attractive though not beautiful features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The odour emanating from so many dead fowls, on which the sun, already
      high in the heavens, was shining, became disagreeable to her, and a strong
      sense of discomfort, whose cause, however, she did not seek, made her turn
      from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement with which she did so was full of quiet, stately grace, and
      the admiring glance with which Hermon, a tall, black-bearded young man,
      watched it, showed that he knew how to value the exquisite symmetry of her
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The somewhat full outlines of her form and the self-possession of her
      bearing would have led every one to think her a young matron rather than a
      girl; but the two artists who accompanied her on the shooting party had
      been intimate with her from childhood, and knew how much modesty and
      genuine kindness of heart were united with the resolute nature of this
      maiden, who numbered two and twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair-haired Myrtilus seemed to pay little heed to the game which Gras,
      Archias&rsquo;s Bithynian house steward, was counting, but black-bearded Hermon
      had given it more attention, and when Daphne drew back he nodded
      approvingly, and pointing to the heap of motionless inhabitants of the
      air, exclaimed with sincere regret: &ldquo;Fie upon us human wretches! Would the
      most bloodthirsty hyena destroy such a number of living creatures in a few
      hours? Other beasts of prey do not kill even one wretched sparrow more
      than they need to appease their hunger. But we and you, tender-hearted
      priestess of a gracious goddess&mdash;leading us friends of the Muse&mdash;we
      pursue a different course! What a mound of corpses! And what will become
      of it? Perhaps a few geese and ducks will go into the kitchen; but the
      rest&mdash;the red flamingoes and the brave pelicans who feed their young
      with their own blood? They are only fit to throw away, for the Biamites
      eat no game that is shot, and your black slaves, too, would refuse to
      taste it. So we destroy hundreds of lives for pastime. Base word! As if we
      had so many superfluous hours at our disposal ere we descend into Hades. A
      philosopher among brutes would be entitled to cry out, &lsquo;Shame upon you,
      raging monster!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on you, you perpetual grumbler,&rdquo; interrupted Daphne in an offended
      tone. &ldquo;Who would ever have thought it cruel to test the steady hand and
      the keen eye upon senseless animals in the joyous chase? But what shall we
      call the fault-finder, who spoils his friend&rsquo;s innocent enjoyment of a
      happy morning by his sharp reproaches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon shrugged his shoulders, and, in a voice which expressed far more
      compassion than resentment, answered: &ldquo;If this pile of dead birds pleases
      you, go on with the slaughter. You can sometimes save the arrows and catch
      the swarming game with your hands. If your lifeless victims yonder were
      human beings, after all, they would have cause to thank you; for what is
      existence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To these creatures, everything,&rdquo; said Myrtilus, the Alexandrian&rsquo;s other
      cousin, beckoning to Daphne, who had summoned him to her aid by a
      beseeching glance, to draw nearer. &ldquo;Gladly as I would always and
      everywhere uphold your cause, I can not do so this time. Only look here!
      Your arrow merely broke the wing of yonder sea eagle, and he is just
      recovering from the shock. What a magnificent fellow! How wrathfully and
      vengefully his eyes sparkle! How fiercely he stretches his brave head
      toward us in helpless fury, and&mdash;step back!&mdash;how vigorously,
      spite of the pain of his poor, wounded, drooping pinion, he flaps the
      other, and raises his yellow claws to punish his foes! His plumage
      glistens and shines exquisitely where it lies smooth, and how savagely he
      puffs out the feathers on his neck! A wonderful spectacle! The embodiment
      of powerful life! And the others by his side. We transformed the poor
      creatures into a motionless, miserable mass, and just now they were
      cleaving the air with their strong wings, proclaiming by proud, glad cries
      to their families among the reeds their approach with an abundant store of
      prey. Every one was a feast to the eyes before our arrows struck it, and
      now? When Hermon, with his pitying heart, condemns this kind of hunting,
      he is right. It deprives free, harmless creatures of their best possession&mdash;life&mdash;and
      us thereby of a pleasant sight. In general, a bird&rsquo;s existence seems to me
      also of little value, but beauty, to me as to you, transcends everything
      else. What would existence be without it? and wherever it appears, to
      injure it is infamous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a slight cough interrupted the young artist, and the moist glitter of
      his blue eyes also betrayed that he was suffering from an attack of severe
      pain in his lungs; but Daphne nodded assent to him, and to Hermon also,
      and commanded the steward Gras to take the birds out of her sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Bithynian, &ldquo;our mistress will doubtless allow us at least
      to take the hard lower part of the pelicans&rsquo; beaks, and the wing feathers
      of the flamingoes and birds of prey, to show our master on our return as
      trophies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trophies?&rdquo; repeated the girl scornfully. &ldquo;Hermon, you are better than I
      and the rest of us, and I see that you are right. Where game flies toward
      us in such quantities, hunting becomes almost murder. And successes won by
      so slight an exertion offer little charm. The second expedition before
      sunset, Gras, shall be given up. The master of the hounds, with his men
      and the dogs, will return home on the transports this very day. I am
      disgusted with sport here. Birds of prey, and those only when brought down
      from the air, would probably be the right game in this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are the very ones to which I would grant life,&rdquo; said Hermon,
      smiling, &ldquo;because they enjoy it most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will at least save the sea eagle,&rdquo; cried Daphne, and ordered the
      steward, who was already having the dead fowl carried off, to care for the
      wounded bird of prey; but when the latter struck furiously with his beak
      at the Biamite who attempted to remove it, Hermon again turned to the
      girl, saying: &ldquo;I thank you in the eagle&rsquo;s name for your good will, you
      best of women; but I fear even the most careful nursing will not help this
      wounded creature, for the higher one seeks to soar, the more surely he
      goes to destruction if his power of flight is broken. Mine, too, was
      seriously injured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here?&rdquo; asked Daphne anxiously. &ldquo;At this time, which is of such great
      importance to you and your art?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she interrupted herself to ask Myrtilus&rsquo;s opinion, but as he had gone
      away coughing, she continued, in a softer tone: &ldquo;How anxious you can make
      one, Hermon! Has anything really happened which clouds your pleasure in
      creating, and your hope of success?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us wait,&rdquo; he answered, hastily throwing back his head, with its
      thick, waving raven locks. &ldquo;If, in leaping over the ditch, I should fall
      into the marsh, I must endure it, if thereby I can only reach the shore
      where my roses bloom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you fear that you have failed in the Demeter?&rdquo; asked Daphne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Failed?&rdquo; repeated the other. &ldquo;That seems too strong. Only the work is not
      proving as good as I originally expected. For the head we both used a
      model&mdash;you will see&mdash;whose fitness could not be surpassed. But
      the body! Myrtilus knows how earnestly I laboured, and, without looking to
      the right or the left, devoted all my powers to the task of creation.
      True, the models did not remain. But even had a magic spell doubled my
      ability, the toil would still have been futile. The error is there; yet I
      am repairing it. To be sure, many things must aid me in doing so, for
      which I now hope; who knows whether it will not again be in vain? You are
      acquainted with my past life. It has never yet granted me any great,
      complete success, and if I was occasionally permitted to pluck a flower,
      my hands were pricked by thorns and nettles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pursed up his lips as if to hiss the unfriendly fate, and Daphne felt
      that he, whose career she had watched from childhood with the interest of
      affection, and to whom, though she did not confess it even to herself, she
      had clung for years with far more than sisterly love, needed a kind word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart ached, and it was difficult for her to assume the cheerful tone
      which she desired to use; but she succeeded, and her voice sounded gay and
      careless enough as she exclaimed to the by no means happy artist and
      Myrtilus, who was just returning: &ldquo;Give up your foolish opposition, you
      obstinate men, and let me see what you have accomplished during this long
      time. You promised my father that you would show your work to no one
      before him, but believe my words, if he were here he would give you back
      the pledge and lead me himself to the last production of your study.
      Compassion would compel you disobliging fellows to yield, if you could
      only imagine how curiosity tortures us women. We can conquer it where more
      indifferent matters are concerned. But here!&mdash;it need not make you
      vainer than you already are, but except my father, you are dearest in all
      the world to me. And then, only listen! In my character as priestess of
      Demeter I hereby release you from your vow, and thus from any evil
      consequences of your, moreover, very trivial guilt; for a father and
      daughter who live together, as I do with your uncle, are just the same as
      one person. So come! Wearied as I am by the miserable hunting excursion
      which caused me such vexation, in the presence of your works&mdash;rely
      upon it&mdash;I shall instantly be gay again, and all my life will thank
      you for your noble indulgence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, she walked toward the white house, beckoning to the young
      men with a winning, encouraging smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to produce the effect intended, for the artists looked at each
      other irresolutely, and Hermon was already asking himself whether Daphne&rsquo;s
      arguments had convinced Myrtilus also, when the latter, in great
      excitement, called after her: &ldquo;How gladly we would do it, but we must not
      fulfil your wish, for it was no light promise&mdash;no, your father
      exacted an oath. He alone can absolve us from the obligation of showing
      him, before any one else, what we finish here. It is not to be submitted
      to the judges until after he has seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me!&rdquo; Daphne interrupted with urgent warmth, and began to assail
      the artists with fresh entreaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time black-bearded Hermon seemed inclined to give up his
      resistance, but Myrtilus cried in zealous refusal: &ldquo;For Hermon&rsquo;s sake, I
      insist upon my denial. The judges must not talk about the work until both
      tasks are completed, for then each of us will be as good as certain of a
      prize. I myself believe that the one for Demeter will fall to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Hermon will succeed better with the Arachne?&rdquo; asked Daphne eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myrtilus warmly assented, but Hermon exclaimed: &ldquo;If I could only rely upon
      the good will of the judges!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; the girl interrupted. &ldquo;My father is just, the king is an
      incorruptible connoisseur, and certainly yesterday evening you, too,
      believed the others to be honest men; as for your fellow-candidate
      Myrtilus, he will no more grudge a prize to you than to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he?&rdquo; asked Hermon, as if he, too, was perfectly sure of his
      friend. &ldquo;We have shared many a bit of bread together. When we determined
      upon this competition each knew the other&rsquo;s ability. Your father
      commissioned us to create peaceful Demeter, the patroness of agriculture,
      peace, marriage, and Arachne, the mortal who was the most skilful of
      spinners; for he is both a grain dealer and owner of spinning factories.
      The best Demeter is to be placed in the Alexandrian temple of the goddess,
      to whose priestesses you belong; the less successful one in your own house
      in the city, but whose Demeter is destined for the sanctuary, I repeat, is
      now virtually decided. Myrtilus will add this prize to the others, and
      grant me with all his heart the one for the Arachne. The subject, at any
      rate, is better adapted to my art than to his, and so I should be
      tolerably certain of my cause. Yet my anxiety about the verdict of the
      judges remains, for surely you know how much the majority are opposed to
      my tendency. I, and the few Alexandrians who, following me, sacrifice
      beauty to truth, swim against the stream which bears you, Myrtilus, and
      those who are on your side, smoothly along. I know that you do it from
      thorough conviction, but with other acknowledged great artists and our
      judges, you, too, demand beauty&mdash;always beauty. Am I right, or wrong?
      Is not any one who refuses to follow in the footsteps left by the ancients
      of Athens as certain of condemnation as the convicted thief or murderer?
      But I will not follow the lead of the Athenians, inimitably great though
      they are in their own way, because I would fain be more than the ancients
      of Ilissus: a disciple and an Alexandrian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The never-ending dispute,&rdquo; Myrtilus answered his fellow-artist, with a
      cordiality in which, nevertheless, there was a slight accent of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you know it, Daphne. To me the ideal and its embodiment within the
      limits of the natural, according to the models of Phidias, Polycletus, and
      Myron is the highest goal, but he and his co-workers seek objects nearer
      at hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or rather we found them,&rdquo; cried Hermon, interrupting his companion with
      angry positiveness. &ldquo;The city of Alexandria, which is growing with
      unprecedented vigour, is their home. There, the place to which every race
      on earth sends a representative, the pulse of the whole world is
      throbbing. There, whoever does not run with the rest is run over; there,
      but one thing is important&mdash;actual life. Science has undertaken to
      fathom it, and the results which it gains with measures and numbers is of
      a different value and more lasting than that which the idle sport of the
      intellects of the older philosophers obtained. But art, her nobler sister,
      must pursue the same paths. To copy life as it is, to reproduce the real
      as it presents itself, not as it might or must be, is the task which I set
      myself. If you would have me carve gods, whom man can not represent to
      himself except in his own form, allow me also to represent them as reality
      shows me mortals. I will form them after the models of the greatest,
      highest, and best, and also, when the subject permits, in powerful action
      in accordance with my own power, but always as real men from head to foot.
      We must also cling to the old symbols which those who order demand,
      because they serve as signs of recognition, and my Demeter, too, received
      the bundle of wheat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the excited artist uttered this challenge a defiant glance rested upon
      his comrade and Daphne. But Myrtilus, with a soothing gesture of the hand,
      answered: &ldquo;What is the cause of this heat? I at least watch your work with
      interest, and do not dispute your art so long as it does not cross the
      boundaries of the beautiful, which to me are those of art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the conversation was interrupted; the steward Gras brought a letter
      which a courier from Pelusium had just delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone, the wife of Philippus, the commander of the strong border fortress
      of Pelusium, near Tennis, had written it. She and her husband had been
      intimate friends of Hermon&rsquo;s father, who had served under the old general
      as hipparch, and through him had become well acquainted with his wealthy
      brother Archias and his relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alexandrian merchant had informed Philippus&mdash;whom, like all the
      world, he held in the highest honour as one of the former companions of
      Alexander the Great&mdash;of his daughter&rsquo;s journey, and his wife now
      announced her visit to Daphne. She expected to reach Tennis that evening
      with her husband and several friends, and mentioned especially her
      anticipation of meeting Hermon, the son of her beloved Erigone and her
      husband&rsquo;s brave companion in arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne and Myrtilus received the announcement with pleasure; but Hermon,
      who only the day before had spoken of the old couple with great affection,
      seemed disturbed by the arrival of the unexpected guests. To avoid them
      entirely appeared impossible even to him, but he declared in an
      embarrassed tone, and without giving any reason, that he should scarcely
      be able to devote the entire evening to Daphne and the Pelusinians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned quickly toward the house, to which a signal from his slave
      Bias summoned him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as Hermon had disappeared behind the door Daphne begged Myrtilus
      to accompany her into the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      After taking their seats there, the anxious exclamation escaped her lips:
      &ldquo;How excited he became again! The stay in Tennis does not seem to agree
      with you&mdash;you are coughing, and father expected so much benefit to
      your ailment from the pure moist air, and to Hermon still more from the
      lonely life here in your society. But I have rarely seen him more strongly
      enlisted in behalf of the tendency opposed to beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your father must be satisfied with the good effect which our
      residence here has exerted upon me,&rdquo; replied Myrtilus. &ldquo;I know that he was
      thinking of my illness when he proposed to us to complete his commissions
      here. Hermon&mdash;the good fellow!&mdash;could never have been induced to
      leave his Alexandria, had not the hope of thereby doing me a kindness
      induced him to follow me. I will add it to the many for which I am already
      indebted to his friendship. As for art, he will go his own way, and any
      opposition would be futile. A goddess&mdash;he perceives it himself&mdash;was
      certainly the most unfortunate subject possible for his&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his Demeter a complete failure?&rdquo; asked Daphne anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Myrtilus eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The head is even one of his very best. Only the figure awakens grave
      doubts. In the effort to be faithful to reality, the fear of making
      concessions to beauty, he lapsed into ungraceful angularity and a
      sturdiness which, in my opinion, would be unpleasing even in a mortal
      woman. The excess of unbridled power again makes it self visible in the
      wonderfully gifted man. Many things reached him too late, and others too
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne eagerly asked what he meant by these words, and Myrtilus replied:
      &ldquo;Surely you know how he became a sculptor. Your father had intended him to
      be his successor in business, but Hermon felt the vocation to become an
      artist&mdash;probably first in my studio&mdash;awake with intense force.
      While I early placed myself under the instruction of the great Bryaxis, he
      was being trained for a merchant&rsquo;s life. When he was to guide the reed in
      the counting-house, he sketched; when he was sent to the harbour to direct
      the loading of the ships, he became absorbed in gazing at the statues
      placed there. In the warehouse he secretly modelled, instead of attending
      to the bales of goods. You are certainly aware what a sad breach occurred
      then, and how long Hermon was restrained before he succeeded in turning
      his back upon trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father meant so kindly toward him,&rdquo; Daphne protested. &ldquo;He was
      appointed guardian to you both. You are rich, and therefore he aided in
      every possible way your taste for art; but Hermon did not inherit from his
      parents a single drachm, and so my father saw the most serious struggles
      awaiting him if he devoted himself to sculpture. And, besides, he had
      destined his nephew to become his successor, the head of one of the
      largest commercial houses in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in doing so,&rdquo; Myrtilus responded, &ldquo;he believed he had made the best
      provision for his happiness. But there is something peculiar in art. I
      know from your father himself how kind his intentions were when he
      withdrew his assistance from Hermon, and when he had escaped to the island
      of Rhodes, left him to make his own way during the first period of
      apprenticeship through which he passed there. Necessity, he thought, would
      bring him back to where he had a life free from anxiety awaiting him. But
      the result was different. Far be it from me to blame the admirable
      Archias, yet had he permitted his ward to follow his true vocation
      earlier, it would have been better for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think that he began to study too late?&rdquo; asked Daphne eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too late,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but with his passionate struggle to
      advance, an earlier commencement would have been more favourable. While
      the companions of his own age were already doing independent work, he was
      still a student, and so it happened that he began for himself too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; Daphne answered, &ldquo;can you deny that, directly after Hermon produced
      his first work which made his talent undeniable, my father again treated
      him like his own son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied Myrtilus, &ldquo;I remember only too well how Archias
      at that time, probably not entirely without your intercession, fairly
      showered gold upon his nephew, but unfortunately this abundance was by no
      means to his advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Daphne. &ldquo;Were not you, at that very time, in
      full possession of the great wealth inherited from your father and mother,
      and yet did you not work far beyond your strength? Bryaxis&mdash;I heard
      him&mdash;was full of your praises, and yet entreated my father to use all
      his influence, as guardian, to warn you against overwork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My kind master!&rdquo; cried Myrtilus, deeply moved. &ldquo;He was as anxious about
      me as a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he perceived that you were destined for great achievements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And because it did not escape his penetration how much I needed care. My
      lungs, Daphne, my lungs&mdash;surely you know how the malicious disease
      became fatal to my clear mother, and to my brother and sister also. All
      three sank prematurely into the grave, and for years the shades of my
      parents have been beckoning to me too. When the cough shakes my chest, I
      see Charon raise his oar and invite me also to enter his sable boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you just assured me that you were doing well,&rdquo; observed the girl.
      &ldquo;The cough alone makes me a little anxious. If you could only see for
      yourself what a beautiful colour the pure air has given your cheeks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This flush,&rdquo; replied Myrtilus gravely, &ldquo;is the sunset of life&rsquo;s closing
      day, not the dawn of approaching convalescence. But let us drop the
      subject. I allude to these sorrowful things only to prevent your praises
      of me at Hermon&rsquo;s expense. True, even while a student I possessed wealth
      far beyond my needs, but the early deaths of my brother and sister had
      taught me even then to be economical of the brief span of life allotted to
      me. Hermon, on the contrary, was overflowing with manly vigour, and the
      strongest among the Ephebi in the wrestling school. After three nights&rsquo; 
      revel he would not even feel weary, and how difficult the women made it
      for the handsome, black-bearded fellow to commence his work early! Did you
      ever ask yourself why young steeds are not broken in flowery meadows, but
      upon sand? Nothing which attracts their attention and awakens their
      desires must surround them; but your father&rsquo;s gold led Hermon, ere the
      season of apprenticeship was over, into the most luxuriant clover fields.
      Honour and respect the handsome, hot-blooded youth that, nevertheless, he
      allowed himself to be diverted from work only a short time and soon
      resumed it with ardent zeal, at first in superabundance, and then amid
      fresh need and privation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Myrtilus,&rdquo; the girl interrupted, &ldquo;how terribly I suffered in those
      days! For the first time the gods made me experience that there are black
      clouds, as well as bright sunshine, in the human soul. For weeks an
      impassable gulf separated me from my father, with whom I had always had
      one heart and soul. But I never saw him as he was then. The first prize
      had been awarded to you for your Aphrodite, radiant in marvellous beauty,
      and your brow had also been already crowned for your statue of Alexander,
      when Hermon stepped forward with his works. They were at the same time the
      first which were to show what he believed to be the true mission of art&mdash;a
      hideous hawker, hide in hand, praising his wares with open mouth, and the
      struggling Maenads. Surely you know the horrible women who throw one
      another on the ground, tearing and rending with bestial fury. The
      spectacle of these fruits of the industry of one dear to me grieved me
      also, and I could not understand how you and the others saw anything to
      admire in them. And my father! At the sight of these things the colour
      faded from his cheeks and lips, and, as if by virtue of his guardianship
      he had a right to direct Hermon in the paths of art also, he forbade his
      ward to waste any more time in such horrible scarecrows, and awaken
      loathing and wrath instead of gratification, exultation, and joy. You know
      the consequences, but you do not know how my heart ached when Hermon,
      frantic with wounded pride and indignation, turned his back upon my father
      and severed every tie that united him to us. In spite of his deep vexation
      and the unbridled violence with which the nephew had allowed himself to
      address his uncle, my father did not dream of withholding his assistance
      from him. But Hermon no longer came to our house, and when I sent for him
      to bring him to reason, he positively declared that he would not accept
      another obolus from my father&mdash;he would rather starve than permit any
      one to dictate to him in the choice of his subjects. Liberty was worth
      more than his uncle&rsquo;s gold. Yet my father sent him his annual allowance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he refused it,&rdquo; added Myrtilus. &ldquo;I remember that day well, how I
      tried to persuade him, and, when he persisted in his intention, besought
      him to accept from my abundance what he needed. But this, too, he
      resolutely refused, though at that time I was already so deeply in his
      debt that I could not repay him at all with paltry money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking of the devotion with which he nursed you when you were
      so ill?&rdquo; asked Daphne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; yet not of that alone,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You do not know how he
      stood by me in the worst days. Who was it that after my first great
      successes, when base envy clouded many an hour of my life, rejoiced with
      me as though he himself had won the laurel? It was he, the ambitious
      artist, though recognition held even farther aloof from his creations than
      success. And when, just at that time, the insidious disease attacked me
      more cruelly than ever, he devoted himself to me like a loving brother.
      While formerly, in the overflowing joy of existence, he had revelled all
      day and caroused all night, how often he paused in the rush of gaiety to
      exchange the festal hall for a place beside my couch, frequently remaining
      there until Eos dyed the east, that he might hold my fevered hand and
      support my shaken frame! Frequently too, when already garlanded for some
      gay banquet, he took the flowers from his head and devoted the night to
      his friend, that he might not leave him to the attendance of the slaves.
      It is owing to him, and the care and skill of the great leech
      Erasistratus, that I am still standing before you alive and can praise
      what my Hermon was and proved himself to me in those days. Yet I must also
      accuse him of a wrong; to this hour I bear him a grudge for having, in
      those sorrowful hours, refused to share my property with me fraternally.
      What manly pride would have cheerfully permitted him to accept was opposed
      by the defiant desire to show me, your father, you, the whole world, that
      he would depend upon himself, and needed assistance neither from human
      beings nor even the gods. In the same way, while working, he obstinately
      rejected my counsel and my help, though the Muse grants me some things
      which he unfortunately lacks. Great as his talent is, firmly as I believe
      that he will yet succeed some day in creating something grand, nay,
      perhaps something mighty, the unbelieving disciple of Straton lacks the
      power of comprehending the august dignity, the superhuman majesty of the
      divine nature, and he does not succeed in representing the bewitching
      charm of woman, because he hates it as the bull hates a red rag. Only once
      hitherto has he been successful, and that was with your bust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne&rsquo;s cheeks suddenly flamed with a burning flush, and feeling it she
      raised her feather fan to her eyes, and with forced indifference murmured:
      &ldquo;We were good friends from our earliest childhood. And, besides, how small
      is the charm with which the artist who chooses me for a model has to
      deal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather an unusually fascinating one,&rdquo; Myrtilus asserted resolutely.
      &ldquo;I have no idea of flattering you, and you are certainly aware that I do
      not number you among the beauties of Alexandria. But instead of the
      delicate, symmetrical features which artists need, the gods bestowed upon
      you a face which wins all hearts, even those of women, because it is a
      mirror of genuine, helpful, womanly kindness, a sincere disposition, and a
      healthy, receptive mind. To reproduce such a face, not exactly beautiful,
      and yet bewitching, is the hardest possible task, and Hermon, I repeat it,
      has succeeded. You are the only one of your noble sex who inspires the
      motherless man with respect, and for whom he feels more than a fleeting
      fancy. What does he not owe you? After the bridge which united him to his
      uncle and paternal friend had been so suddenly broken, it was you who
      rebuilt it. Now, I think, it is stronger than ever. I could not imagine
      anything that would induce him to give you up; and all honour to your
      father, who, instead of bearing the insubordinate fellow a grudge, only
      drew him more warmly to his heart, and gave us two commissions which will
      permit each to do his best. If I see clearly, the daughter of Archias is
      closely connected with this admirable deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Daphne, &ldquo;my father discussed his intention with me,
      but the thought was entirely his own. True, Hermon&rsquo;s Street-Boy eating
      Figs was not exactly according to his taste, but it pleased him better
      than his former works, and I agree with Euphranor, it is remarkably true
      to nature. My father perceived this too. Besides, he is a merchant who
      sets a high value upon what he has earned, and Hermon&rsquo;s refusal of his
      gold startled him. Then the good man also saw how nobly, in spite of his
      wild life, his obstinacy, and the work so unpleasing to him, his nephew
      always showed the noble impulses inherited from his brave father, and thus
      Hermon gained the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would have become of him last year, after the mortifying
      rejection of his model of The Happy Return Home for the harbour of
      Eunostus,&rdquo; asked Myrtilus, &ldquo;if you and your encouragement had not cheered
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That verdict, too, was abominable!&rdquo; exclaimed Daphne indignantly. &ldquo;The
      mother opening her arms to the returning son was unlovely, it is true, and
      did not please me either; but the youth with the travelling hat and staff
      is magnificent in his vigour and natural action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That opinion, as you know, is mine also,&rdquo; replied Myrtilus. &ldquo;In the
      mother the expression was intended to take the place of beauty. For the
      returning son, as well as for the fig-eater, he found a suitable model.
      True, the best was at his disposal for his Demeter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he hesitated; but Daphne so urgently asked to know what he, who had
      already denied her admission to the studios, was now again withholding
      from her, that, smiling indulgently, he added: &ldquo;Then I must probably
      consent to tell in advance the secret with which you were to be surprised.
      Before him, as well as before me, hovered&mdash;since you wish to know it&mdash;in
      Alexandria, when we first began to model the head of the goddess, a
      certain charming face which is as dear to one as to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne, joyously excited, held out her hand to the artist, exclaiming:
      &ldquo;Oh, how kind that is! Yet how was it possible, since I posed neither to
      him nor to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hermon had finished your bust only a short time before, and you permitted
      me to use your head for my statue of the goddess of Peace, which went down
      with the ship on the voyage to Ostia. This was at the disposal of us both
      in three or four reproductions, and, besides, it hovered before our mental
      vision clearly enough. When the time to show you our work arrives, you
      will be surprised to discover how differently two persons see and copy the
      same object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I know so much, and have a certain share in your works, I insist
      upon seeing them!&rdquo; cried Daphne with far greater impetuosity than usual.
      &ldquo;Tell Hermon so, and remind him that I shall at any rate expect him to
      meet the Pelusinian guests at the banquet. Threaten him seriously with my
      grave displeasure if he persists in leaving it speedily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not fail to do my part,&rdquo; replied Myrtilus; &ldquo;but as to your wish to
      see the two Demeters&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will come to pass,&rdquo; interrupted Daphne, &ldquo;as soon as we three are
      together again like a clover leaf.&rdquo; She returned the sculptor&rsquo;s farewell
      greeting as she spoke, but before he reached the entrance to the tent she
      again detained him with the exclamation: &ldquo;Only this one thing more: Does
      Hermon deceive himself when he hopes so confidently for success with the
      weaver, Arachne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly&mdash;if the model whom he desires does not fail him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she beautiful, and did he find her here in Tennis?&rdquo; asked Daphne,
      trying to assume an indifferent manner; but Myrtilus was not deceived, and
      answered gaily: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way people question children to find out
      things. Farewell until the banquet, fair curiosity!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The slave Bias had not gone to the hunting party with his master. He had
      never been fit for such expeditions, since the Egyptian guard who took him
      to the slave market for sale crippled the arch-traitor&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s left leg by
      a blow, but he was all the more useful in the house, and even the keenest
      eye could scarcely now perceive the injury which lessened his commercial
      value.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had prepared everything his master would need to shoot the birds very
      early in the morning, and after helping the men push the boats into the
      water, he, too, remained out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Nubian doorkeeper&rsquo;s little badger dog ran to meet him, as usual,
      barking loudly, and startled a flock of sparrows, which flew up directly
      in front of Bias and fluttered to and fro in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slave regarded this as an infallible omen, and when Stephanion,
      Daphne&rsquo;s maid, who had grown gray in the household of Archias, and though
      a freed woman still worked in the old way, came out of the tent, he called
      to her the gay Greek greeting, &ldquo;Rejoice!&rdquo; pointed to the sparrows, and
      eagerly continued: &ldquo;How one flies above another! how they flutter and
      chirp and twitter! It will be a busy day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanion thought this interpretation of the ordinary action of the birds
      very consistent with Bias&rsquo;s wisdom, which was highly esteemed in the
      household of Archias, and it also just suited her inclination to chat with
      him for a while, especially as she had brought a great deal of news from
      Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of introduction she mentioned the marriages and deaths in their
      circle of acquaintances, bond and free, and then confided to the slave
      what had induced her mistress to remain so long absent from her father,
      whom she usually left alone for only a few hours at the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archias himself had sent her here, after young Philotas, who was now
      apparently wooing her with better success than other suitors, had spoken
      of the enormous booty which one of his friends had brought from a shooting
      expedition at Tennis, and Daphne had expressed a wish to empty her quiver
      there too.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, Philotas himself had been eager to guide the hunting party, but
      Daphne declined his escort because&mdash;so the maid asserted&mdash;she
      cared far more about meeting her cousins, the sculptors, than for the
      chase. Her mistress had frankly told her so, but her father was delighted
      to hear her express a wish, because for several months she had been so
      quiet and listless that she, Stephanion, had become anxious about her.
      Meanwhile, Daphne had tried honestly to conceal her feelings from the old
      man, but such games of hide and seek were useless against the master&rsquo;s
      keen penetration. He spared no pains in the preparations for the journey,
      and the girl now seemed already transformed. This was caused solely by
      meeting her cousins again; but if any one should ask her whether Daphne
      preferred Myrtilus or Hermon, she could not give a positive answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cautious inquiry saves recantation,&rdquo; replied Bias importantly. &ldquo;Yet you
      may believe my experience, it is Myrtilus. Fame inspires love, and what
      the world will not grant my master, in spite of his great talent, it
      conceded to the other long ago. And, besides, we are not starving; but
      Myrtilus is as rich as King Croesus of Sardis. Not that Daphne, who is
      stifling in gold herself, would care about that, but whoever knows life
      knows&mdash;where doves are, doves will fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephanion, however, was of a different opinion, not only because Daphne
      talked far more about the black-bearded cousin than the fair one, but
      because she knew the girl, and was seldom mistaken in such matters. She
      would not deny that Daphne was also fond of Myrtilus. Yet probably neither
      of the artists, but Philotas, would lead home the bride, for he was
      related to the royal family&mdash;a fine, handsome man; and, besides, her
      father preferred him to the other suitors who hovered around her as flies
      buzzed about honey. Of course, matters would be more favourable to
      Philotas in any other household. Who else in Alexandria would consult the
      daughter long, when he was choosing her future husband? But Archias was a
      white raven among fathers, and would never force his only child to do
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrying and loving, however, were two different affairs. If Eros had the
      final decision, her choice might perhaps fall on one of the artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she was interrupted by the slave&rsquo;s indignant exclamation: &ldquo;What
      contradictions! &lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s hair is long, but her wit is short,&rsquo; says the
      proverb. &lsquo;Waiting is the merchant&rsquo;s wisdom,&rsquo; I have heard your master say
      more than once, and to obey the words of shrewd people is the best plan
      for those who are not so wise. Meanwhile, I am of the opinion that
      curiosity alone brought Daphne&mdash;who, after all, is only a woman&mdash;to
      this place. She wants to see the statues of Demeter which her father
      ordered from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Arachne?&rdquo; asked the maid. This was an opportune question to the
      slave&mdash;how often he had heard the artists utter the word &ldquo;Arachne!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      his pride of education had suffered from the consciousness that he knew
      nothing about her except the name, which in Greek meant &ldquo;the spider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some special story must surely be associated with this Arachne, for which
      his master desired to use his young countrywoman, Ledscha, as a model, and
      whose statues Archias intended to place in his house in Alexandria and in
      the great weaving establishment at Tennis beside the statue of Demeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanion, a Greek woman who grew up in a Macedonian household, must know
      something about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he cautiously turned the conversation to the spinner Arachne, and when
      Stephanion entered into it, admitted that he, too, was curious to learn in
      what way the sculptors would represent her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the maid, &ldquo;my mistress has more than once racked her brains
      over that, and Archias too. Perhaps they will carve her as a girl at work
      in the house of her father Idmon, the purple dyer of Colophon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied Bias in a tone of dissent. &ldquo;Just imagine how the loom
      would look wrought in gold and ivory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so too,&rdquo; said Stephanion, in apology for the foolish idea.
      &ldquo;Daphne thinks that the two will model her in different ways: Myrtilus, as
      mistress in the weaving room, showing with proud delight a piece just
      completed to the nymphs from the Pactolus and other rivers, who sought her
      at Colophon to admire her work; but Hermon, after she aroused the wrath of
      Athene because she dared to weave into the hangings the love adventures of
      the gods with mortal women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Zeus as a swan toying with Leda,&rdquo; replied Bias as confidently as
      if Arachne&rsquo;s works were before his eyes, &ldquo;and in the form of a bull
      bearing away Europa, the chaste Artemis bending over the sleeping
      Endymion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How that pleases you men!&rdquo; interrupted the maid, striking him lightly on
      the arm with the duster which she had brought from the tent. &ldquo;But ought
      the virgin Athene to be blamed because she punished the weaver who, with
      all her skill, was only a mortal woman, for thus exposing her divine
      kindred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Bias, and Stephanion went on eagerly: &ldquo;And when
      the great Athene, who invented weaving and protects weavers, condescended
      to compete with Arachne, and was excelled by her, surely her gall must
      have overflowed. Whoever is just will scarcely blame her for striking the
      audacious conqueror on the brow with the weaver&rsquo;s shuttle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that very thing,&rdquo; replied Bias modestly, &ldquo;which to a short-sighted
      fool like myself&mdash;may the great goddess not bear me a grudge for it!&mdash;never
      seemed just in her. Even the mortal who succumbs in a fair fight ought not
      to be enraged against the victor. At least, so I was taught. But what, I
      ask myself, when I think of the stones which were flung at Hermon&rsquo;s
      struggling Maenads, could be less suited for imitation than two women, one
      of whom strikes the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman who in her desperation at that blow desires to hang herself,
      must produce a still more horrible impression,&rdquo; replied Stephanion.
      &ldquo;Probably she will be represented as Athene releases her from the noose
      rather than when, as a punishment for her insolence, she transforms
      Arachne into a spider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she might be permitted, in the form of an insect, to make artistic
      webs until the end of her life,&rdquo; the slave, now sufficiently well
      informed, added importantly. &ldquo;Since that transformation, as you know, the
      spider has been called by the Greeks Arachne. Perhaps&mdash;I always
      thought so&mdash;Hermon will represent her twisting the rope with which
      she is to kill herself. You have seen many of our works, and know that we
      love the terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let me go into your studio!&rdquo; the maid now entreated no less urgently
      than her mistress had done a short time before, but her wish, too,
      remained ungratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sculptors,&rdquo; Bias truthfully asserted, &ldquo;always kept their workrooms
      carefully locked.&rdquo; They were as inaccessible as the strongest fortress,
      and it was wise, less on account of curious spectators, from whom there
      was nothing to fear, than of the thievish propensities of the people. The
      statues, by Archias&rsquo;s orders, were to be executed in chryselephantine
      work, and the gold and ivory which this required might only too easily
      awaken the vice of cupidity in the honest and frugal Biamites. So nothing
      could be done about it, not to mention the fact that he was forbidden, on
      pain of being sold to work in a stone quarry, to open the studio to any
      one without his master&rsquo;s consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the maid, too, was obliged to submit, and the sacrifice was rendered
      easier for her because, just at that moment, a young female slave called
      her back to the tent where Chrysilla, Daphne&rsquo;s companion, a matron who
      belonged to a distinguished Greek family, needed her services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias, rejoicing that he had at last learned, without exposing his own
      ignorance, the story of the much-discussed Arachne, returned to the house,
      where he remained until Daphne came back from shooting with her
      companions. While the latter were talking about the birds they had killed,
      Bias went out of doors; but he was forced to give up his desire to listen
      to a conversation which was exactly suited to arrest his attention, for
      after the first few sentences he perceived behind the thorny acacias in
      the &ldquo;garden&rdquo; his countrywoman Ledscha.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was keeping her promise. He recognised her plainly, in spite of the
      veil which covered the back of her head and the lower portion of her face.
      Her black eyes were visible, and what a sinister light shone in them as
      she fixed them sometimes on Daphne, sometimes on Hermon, who stood talking
      together by the steps!
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening before Bias had caught a glimpse of this passionate creature&rsquo;s
      agitated soul. If anything happened here that incensed or wounded her she
      would be capable of committing some unprecedented act before the very
      master&rsquo;s honoured guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent this was a duty to the master whom he loved, and against whom
      he had only warned Ledscha because he was reluctant to see a free maiden
      of his own race placed on a level with the venal Alexandrian models, but
      still more because any serious love affair between Hermon and the Biamite
      might bring disastrous consequences upon both, and therefore also on
      himself. He knew that the free men of his little nation would not suffer
      an insult offered by a Greek to a virgin daughter of their lineage to pass
      unavenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, in his bondage he had by no means remained free from all the bad
      qualities of slaves, but he was faithfully devoted to his master, who had
      imposed upon him a great debt of gratitude; for though, during the trying
      period of variance with his rich and generous uncle, Hermon had often been
      offered so large a sum for him that it would have relieved the artist from
      want, he could not be induced to yield his &ldquo;wise and faithful Bias&rdquo; to
      another. The slave had sworn to himself that he would never forget this,
      and he kept his oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freedmen and slaves were moving to and fro in the large open square before
      him, amid the barking of the dogs and the shouts of the male and female
      venders of fruit, vegetables, and fish, who hoped to dispose of their
      wares in the kitchen tent of the wealthy strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The single veiled woman attracted no attention here, but Bias kept his
      gaze fixed steadily upon her, and as she curved her little slender hand
      above her brow to shade her watchful eyes from the dazzling sunlight, and
      set her beautifully arched foot on a stone near one of the trees in order
      to gain a better view, he thought of the story of the weaver which he had
      just heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the stillness of the hot noontide was interrupted by many sounds,
      it exerted a bewitching influence over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha seemed like the embodiment of some great danger, and when she
      lowered one arm and raised the other to protect herself again from the
      radiance of the noonday sun, he started; for through the brain of the
      usually fearless man darted the thought that now the nimble spider-legs
      were moving to draw him toward her, entwine him, and suck his heart&rsquo;s
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illusion lasted only a few brief moments, but when it vanished and the
      girl had regained the figure of an unusually slender, veiled Biamite
      woman, he shook his head with a sigh of relief, for never had such a
      vision appeared to him in broad noonday and while awake, and it must have
      been sent to warn him and his master against this uncanny maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      It positively announced some approaching misfortune which proceeded from
      this beautiful creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Biamite now advanced hesitatingly toward Hermon and Daphne, who were
      still a considerable distance from her. But Bias had also quitted his post
      of observation, and after she had taken a few steps forward, barred her
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a curt &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he took her hand, whispering, &ldquo;Hermon is joyously
      expecting your visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha&rsquo;s veil concealed her mouth, but the expression of her eyes made
      him think that it curled scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she silently followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he led her by the hand, but on the way he saw at the edge of her
      upper veil the thick, dark eyebrows which met each other, and her fingers
      seemed to him so strangely cold and tapering that a shudder ran through
      his frame and he released them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha scarcely seemed to notice it, and, with bowed head, walked beside
      him through the side entrance to the door of Hermon&rsquo;s studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a disappointment to her to find it locked, but Bias did not heed
      her angry complaint, and led her into the artist&rsquo;s sitting room,
      requesting her to wait for his master there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he hurried to the steps, and by a significant sign informed the
      sculptor that something important required his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon understood him, and Bias soon had an opportunity to tell the artist
      who it was that desired to speak to him and where he had taken Ledscha. He
      also made him aware that he feared some evil from her, and that, in an
      alarming vision, she had appeared to him as a hideous spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon laughed softly. &ldquo;As a spider? The omen is appropriate. We will make
      her a woman spider&mdash;an Arachne that is worth looking at. But this
      strange beauty is one of the most obstinate of her sex, and if I let her
      carry out her bold visit in broad daylight she will get the better of me
      completely. The blood must first be washed from my hands here. The wounded
      sea eagle tore the skin with its claw, and I concealed the scratch from
      Daphne. A strip of linen to bandage it! Meanwhile, let the impatient
      intruder learn that her sign is not enough to open every door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he entered his sitting room, greeted Ledscha curtly, invited her to
      go into the studio, unlocked it, and left her there alone while he went to
      his chamber with the slave and had the slight wound bandaged comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Bias was helping his master he repeated with sincere anxiety his
      warning against the dangerous beauty whose eyebrows, which had grown
      together, proved that she was possessed by the demons of the nether world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet they increase the austere beauty of her face,&rdquo; assented the artist.
      &ldquo;I should not want to omit them in modelling Arachne while the goddess is
      transforming her into a spider! What a subject! A bolder one was scarcely
      ever attempted and, like you, I already see before me the coming spider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, without the slightest haste, he exchanged the huntsman&rsquo;s chiton for
      the white chlamys, which was extremely becoming to his long, waving beard,
      and at last, exclaiming gaily, &ldquo;If I stay any longer, she will transform
      herself into empty air instead of the spider,&rdquo; he went to her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While waiting in the studio Ledscha had used the time to satisfy her
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was there not to be seen!
    </p>
    <p>
      On pedestals and upon the boards of the floor, on boxes, racks, and along
      the wall, stood, lay, or hung the greatest variety of articles: plaster
      casts of human limbs and parts of the bodies of animals, male and female,
      of clay and wax, withered garlands, all sorts of sculptor&rsquo;s tools, a
      ladder, vases, cups and jars for wine and water, a frame over which linen
      and soft woollen materials were spread, a lute and a zither, several
      seats, an armchair, and in one corner a small table with three dilapidated
      book rolls, writing tablets, metal styluses, and reed pens.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these articles were arranged haphazard, and showed that Bias possessed
      more wisdom than care in the use of duster and broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been difficult to count the number of things brought
      together here, but the unusually long, wide room was by no means crowded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha cast a wondering glance sometimes at one object, sometimes at
      another, but without understanding its meaning or its use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huge figure on the pedestal in the middle of the studio, upon which
      the full glare of light fell through the open windows, was certainly the
      statue of the goddess on which Hermon was working; but a large gray cloth
      concealed it from her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      How tall it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      When she looked at it more closely she felt small and oppressed by
      comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      A passionate longing urged her to remove the cloth, but the boldness of
      the act restrained her. After she had taken another survey of the spacious
      apartment, which she was visiting for the first time by daylight, the
      torturing feeling of being neglected gained possession of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clinched her white teeth more firmly, and when there was a noise at
      the door that died away again without bringing the man she expected, she
      went up to the statue which she had already walked past quietly several
      times and, obeying an impatient impulse, freed it from its covering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goddess, now illumined by the sunlight, shone before her in gleaming
      yellow gold and snowy ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never seen such a statue, and drew back dazzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a master was the man who had deceived her trusting heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had created a Demeter; the wheat in her hand showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      How beautiful this work was&mdash;and how valuable! It produced a powerful
      impression upon her mind, wholly unaccustomed to the estimate of such
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goddess before her was the very one whose statue stood in the temple
      of Demeter, and to whom she also sacrificed, with the Greeks in Tennis,
      when danger threatened the harvest. Involuntarily she removed the lower
      veil from her face and raised her hand in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile she gazed into the pallid face, carved from ivory, of the
      immortal dispenser of blessings, and suddenly the blood crimsoned her
      cheeks, the nostrils of her delicate, slightly arched nose rose and fell
      more swiftly, for the countenance of the goddess&mdash;she was not
      mistaken&mdash;was that of the Alexandrian whom she had just watched so
      intently, and for whose sake Hermon had left her in the lurch the evening
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, too, she remembered for what purpose the sculptor was said to have
      lured Gula, the sailor&rsquo;s wife, and her own young sister Taus, to his
      studio, and in increasing excitement she drew the cloth also from the bust
      beside the Demeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Alexandrian&rsquo;s face&mdash;the likeness was even more unmistakable
      than in the goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greek girl alone occupied his thoughts. Hermon had disdained to model
      the Biamite&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could the others, or she herself, be to him, since he loved the rich
      foreigner in the tent outside, and her alone? How firmly her image must
      have been impressed upon his soul, that he could reproduce the features of
      the absent one with such lifelike fidelity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet with what bold assurance he had protested that his heart belonged
      solely to her. But she thought that she now perceived his purpose. If the
      slave was right, it was done that she might permit him to model what he
      admired in her figure, only not the head and face, whose beauty,
      nevertheless, he praised so extravagantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he attracted Gula and her sister with similar sweet flatteries? Had
      the promise to bestow their charms upon a goddess been made to them also?
    </p>
    <p>
      The swift throbbing of her indignant heart made it impossible for her to
      think calmly, but its vehement pulsation reminded her of the object of her
      presence here.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come to obtain a clear understanding between him and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood here as a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must know whether she had been betrayed or deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He should confess what his intentions toward her were. The next moments
      must decide the fate of her life, and she added, drawing a long breath,
      perhaps of his also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Ledscha started. She had not heard Hermon enter the studio, and
      was now startled by his greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not positively unkind, but certainly not a lover&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the words might have been warmer, but for his annoyance at the
      insolent boldness with which she had removed the coverings from his works.
      He restrained himself from openly blaming her, it is true, but he
      exclaimed, with a tinge of gay sarcasm: &ldquo;You seem to feel very much at
      home here already, fairest of the fair. Or was it the goddess herself who
      removed the curtain from her image in order to show herself to her
      successor upon this pedestal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the question was to remain unanswered, for under the spell of the
      resentment which filled her heart, and in the effort not to lose sight of
      the object that brought her here, Ledscha had only half understood its
      meaning, and pointing her slender forefinger at the face of his completed
      work, she demanded to know whom she recognised in this statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The goddess Demeter,&rdquo; he answered quietly; &ldquo;but if it pleases you better,
      as you seem to be on the right track, also the daughter of Archias.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, angered by the wrathful glance she cast at him, he added more
      sternly: &ldquo;She is kind-hearted, free from disagreeable whims and the
      disposition to torture others who are kindly disposed toward her. So I
      adorned the goddess with her pleasant features.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine, you mean to say,&rdquo; Ledscha answered bitterly, &ldquo;would be less
      suitable for this purpose. Yet they, too, can wear a different expression
      from the present one. You, I think, have learned this. Only I shall never
      acquire the art of dissimulation, not even in your society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be angry on account of my absence yesterday evening?&rdquo; Hermon
      asked in an altered tone, clasping her hand; but Ledscha snatched it from
      him, exclaiming: &ldquo;The model of the Demeter, the daughter of the wealthy
      Archias, detained you, you were going to tell me, and you think that ought
      to satisfy the barbarian maiden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folly!&rdquo; he answered angrily. &ldquo;I owe a debt of gratitude to her father,
      who was my guardian, and custom commands you also to honour a guest. But
      your obstinacy and jealousy are unbearable. What great thing is it that I
      ask of your love? A little patience. Practise it. Then your turn will come
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, the second and third will follow the first,&rdquo; she answered
      bitterly. &ldquo;After Gula, the sailor&rsquo;s wife, you lured my innocent young
      sister, Taus, to this apartment; or am I mistaken in the order, and was
      Gula the second?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Hermon, who was surprised rather than alarmed by
      this betrayal of his secret. &ldquo;If you want confirmation of the fact, very
      well&mdash;both were here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you deluded them with false vows of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. My heart has nothing what ever to do with these visits. Gula
      came to thank me because I rendered her a service&mdash;you know it&mdash;which
      to every mother seems greater than it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you certainly did not underestimate it,&rdquo; Ledscha impetuously
      interrupted, &ldquo;for you demanded her honour in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guard your tongue!&rdquo; the artist burst forth angrily. &ldquo;The woman visited me
      unasked, and I let her leave me as faithful or as unfaithful to her
      husband as she came. If I used her as a model&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gula, whom the sculptor transforms into a goddess,&rdquo; Ledscha interrupted,
      with a sneering laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into a fish-seller, if you wish to know it,&rdquo; cried Hermon indignantly. &ldquo;I
      saw in the market a young woman selling shad. I took the subject, and
      found in Gula a suitable model. Unfortunately, she ventured here far too
      seldom. But I can finish it with the help of the sketch&mdash;it stands in
      yonder cupboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fish-seller,&rdquo; Ledscha repeated contemptuously. &ldquo;And for what did my
      Taus, poor lovely child, seem desirable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over opposite,&rdquo; Hermon answered quickly, as if he wished to get rid of a
      troublesome duty, pointing through the window out of doors, &ldquo;the free
      maidens, during the hot days, took off their sandals and waded through the
      water. There I saw your sister&rsquo;s feet. They were the prettiest of all, and
      Gula brought the young girl to me. I had commenced in Alexandria a figure
      of a girl holding her foot in her hand to take out a thorn, so I used your
      sister&rsquo;s for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when my turn comes?&rdquo; Ledscha demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he replied, freshly captivated by the magic of her beauty, in a
      kinder, almost tender tone, &ldquo;then I will make of you, in gold and ivory,
      you wonderfully lovely creature, the counterpart of this goddess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will need a long time for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The oftener you come the faster the work will advance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the more surely the Biamite women will point their fingers at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you ventured here to-day, unasked, in the broad light of noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wish to remind you myself that I shall expect you this evening.
      Yesterday you did not appear; but to-day-I am right, am I not?&mdash;to-day
      you will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the greatest delight, if it is possible,&rdquo; he answered eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warmer glance from her dark eyes rested upon him. The blood seethed in
      his veins, and as he extended both hands to her and ardently uttered her
      name, she rushed forward, clinging to him with passionate devotion, as if
      seeking assistance, but when his lips touched hers she shrank back and
      loosed her soft arms from his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; asked the sculptor in surprise, trying to draw her
      toward him again; but Ledscha would not permit it, pleading in a softer
      tone than before: &ldquo;Not now; but&mdash;am I not right, dearest&mdash;I may
      expect you this evening? Just this once let the daughter of Archias yield
      to me, who loves you better. We shall have a full moon to-night, and you
      have heard what was predicted to me&mdash;to-night the highest bliss which
      the gods can bestow upon a mortal awaits me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me also,&rdquo; cried Hermon, &ldquo;if you will permit me to share it with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will expect you on the Pelican Island&mdash;just when the full
      moon is over the lofty poplars there. You will come? Not to the Owl&rsquo;s
      Nest: to the Pelican Island. And though your love is far less, far cooler
      than mine, yet you will not defraud me of the best happiness of my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I?&rdquo; he asked, as if he felt wounded by such distrust. &ldquo;What
      detains me must be something absolutely unavoidable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha&rsquo;s eyebrows contracted sharply, and in a choked voice she
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Nothing must detain you&mdash;nothing, whatever it may be!
      Though death should threaten, you will be with me just at midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, if it is possible,&rdquo; he protested, painfully touched by the
      vehemence of her urging. &ldquo;What can be more welcome to me also than to
      spend happy hours with you in the silence of a moonlight night? Besides,
      my stay in Tennis will not be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going?&rdquo; she asked in a hollow tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In three or four days,&rdquo; he answered carelessly; &ldquo;then Myrtilus and I will
      be expected in Alexandria. But gently&mdash;gently&mdash;how pale you are,
      girl! Yes, the parting! But in six weeks at latest I shall be here again;
      then real life will first begin, and Eros will make the roses bloom for
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha nodded silently, and gazing into his face with a searching look
      asked, &ldquo;And how long will this season of blossoming last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several months, girl; three, if not six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who looks so far into the future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her glance, and, as if yielding to the inevitable, answered:
      &ldquo;What a fool I was! Who knows what the morrow may bring? Are we even sure
      whether, six months hence, we shall not hate, instead of loving, each
      other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed her hand across her brow as she spoke, exclaiming: &ldquo;You said
      just now that only the present belonged to man. Then let us enjoy it as
      though every moment might be the last. By the light of the full moon
      to-night, the happiness which has been predicted to me must begin. After
      it, the orb between the horns of Astarte will become smaller; but when it
      fulls and wanes again, if you keep your promise and return, then, though
      they may curse and condemn me, I will come to your studio and grant what
      you ask. But which of the goddesses do you intend to model from me as a
      companion statue to the Demeter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time it can not be one of the immortelles,&rdquo; he answered
      hesitatingly, &ldquo;but a famous woman, an artist who succeeded in a
      competition in vanquishing even the august Athene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is no goddess?&rdquo; Ledscha asked in a disappointed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, child, but the most skilful woman who ever plied the weaver&rsquo;s
      shuttle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arachne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl started, exclaiming contemptuously: &ldquo;Arachne? That is&mdash;that
      is what you Greeks call the most repulsive of creatures&mdash;the spider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most skilful of all creatures, that taught man the noble art of
      weaving,&rdquo; he eagerly retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was interrupted; his friend Myrtilus put his fair head into the
      room, exclaiming: &ldquo;Pardon me if I interrupt you&mdash;but we shall not see
      each other again for some time. I have important business in the city, and
      may be detained a long while. Yet before I go I must perform the
      commission Daphne gave me for you. She sends word that she shall expect
      you without fail at the banquet for the Pelusinian guests. Your absence,
      do you hear?&mdash;pardon the interruption, fairest Ledscha&mdash;your
      absence would seriously anger her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall be prepared for considerable trouble in appeasing her,&rdquo;
       replied Hermon, glancing significantly at the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myrtilus crossed the threshold, turned to the Biamite, and said in his
      quiet, cheerful manner: &ldquo;Where beautiful gifts are to be brought to Eros,
      it beseems the friend to strew with flowers the path of the one who is
      offering the sacrifices; and you, if everything does not deceive me, would
      fain choose to-night to serve him with the utmost devotion. Therefore, I
      shall need forgiveness from you and the god, if I beseech you to defer the
      offering, were it only until to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha silently shrugged her shoulders and made no answer to the
      inquiring glance with which Hermon sought hers, but Myrtilus changed his
      tone and addressed a grave warning to his friend to consider well that it
      would be an insult to the manes of his dead parents if he should avoid the
      old couple from Pelusium, who had been their best friends and had taken
      the journey hither for his sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon looked after him in painful perplexity, but the Biamite also
      approached the threshold, and holding her head haughtily erect, said
      coldly: &ldquo;The choice is difficult for you, as I see. Then recall to your
      memory again what this night of the full moon means&mdash;you are well
      aware of it&mdash;to me. If, nevertheless, you still decide in favour of
      the banquet with your friends, I can not help it; but I must now know:
      Shall this night belong to me, or to the daughter of Archias?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it impossible to talk with you, unlucky girl, as one would with other
      sensible people?&rdquo; Hermon burst forth wrathfully. &ldquo;Everything is carried to
      extremes; you condemn a brief necessary delay as breach of faith and base
      treachery. This behaviour is unbearable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will not come?&rdquo; she asked apathetically, laying her hand upon
      the door; but Hermon cried out in a tone half beseeching, half imperious:
      &ldquo;You must not go so! If you insist upon it, surely I will come. There is
      no room in your obstinate soul for kind indulgence. No one, by the dog,
      ever accused me of being specially skilled in this smooth art; yet there
      may be duties and circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Ledscha gently opened the door; but, seized with a fear of losing
      this rare creature, whose singular beauty attracted him powerfully, even
      now, this peerless model for a work on which he placed the highest hopes,
      he strode swiftly to her side, and drawing her back from the threshold,
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Difficult as it is for me on this special day, I will come,
      only you must not demand what is impossible. The right course often lies
      midway. Half the night must belong to the banquet with my old friends and
      Daphne; the second half&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the barbarian, you think&mdash;the spider,&rdquo; she gasped hoarsely. &ldquo;But
      my welfare as well as yours depends on the decision. Stay here, or come to
      the island&mdash;you have your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wrenching herself from his hold as she spoke, she slipped through the
      doorway and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon, with a muttered oath, stood still, shrugging his shoulders
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could do nothing but yield to this obstinate creature&rsquo;s will.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the atrium Ledscha met the slave Bias, and returned his greeting only
      by a wave of the hand; but before opening the side door which was to lead
      her into the open air, she paused, and asked bluntly in the language of
      their people: &ldquo;Was Arachne&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean the spider, but the weaver
      whom the Greeks call by that name&mdash;a woman like the rest of us? Yet
      it is said that she remained victor in a contest with the goddess Athene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is perfectly true,&rdquo; answered Bias, &ldquo;but she had to atone cruelly for
      this triumph; the goddess struck her on the forehead with the weaver&rsquo;s
      shuttle, and when, in her shame and rage, she tried to hang herself, she
      was transformed into the spider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha stood still, and, while drawing the veil over her pallid face,
      asked with quivering lips, &ldquo;And is there no other Arachne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not among mortals,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but even here in this house there are
      more than enough of the disagreeable, creeping creatures which bear the
      same name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha now went clown the steps which led to the lawn, and Bias saw that
      she stumbled on the last one and would have fallen had not her lithe body
      regained its balance in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad omen!&rdquo; thought the slave. &ldquo;If I had the power to build a wall
      between my master and the spider yonder, it should be higher than the
      lighthouse of Sostratus. To heed omens guides one safely through life. I
      know what I know, and will keep my eyes open, for my master too.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hermon had intended to add a few more touches to his Demeter, but he could
      not do it. Ledscha, her demand, and the resentment with which she had left
      him, were not to be driven from his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt that he must seek her if he was not to lose her, yet he
      reproached himself for having acted like a thoughtless fool when he
      proposed to divide the night between her and Daphne.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something offensive in the proposal to so proud a creature. He
      ought to have promised positively to come, and then left the banquet
      somewhat earlier. It would have been easy to apologize for his late
      arrival, and Ledscha would have had no cause to be angry with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she had, and her resentment awakened in him&mdash;though he certainly
      did not lack manly courage&mdash;an uncomfortable feeling closely allied
      to anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angered by his own conduct, he asked himself whether he loved the
      barbarian, and could find no satisfactory answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At their first meeting he had felt that she was far superior to the other
      Biamite maidens, not only in beauty but in everything else. The very
      acerbity of her nature had seemed charming. To win this wonderful, pliant
      creature, slender as a cypress, whose independence merged into fierce
      obstinacy, had appeared to him worth any sacrifice; and having perceived
      in her an admirable model for his Arachne, he had also determined to brave
      the dangers which might easily arise for the Greek from a love affair with
      a Biamite girl, whose family was free and distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been easier for him to win her heart than he expected; yet at none
      of the meetings which she granted him had he rejoiced in the secret bond
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto her austere reserve had been invincible, and during the greater
      part of their interviews he had been compelled to exert all his influence
      to soothe, appease her, and atone for imprudent acts which he had
      committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, she, too, had often allowed herself to display passionate
      tenderness, but always only to torture him with reproaches and demands
      inspired by her jealousy, suspicion, and wounded pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet her beauty, and the strong power of resistance which she offered to
      his wooing, exerted so bewitching a thrall over him that he had been led
      into conceding far too much, and making vows which he could not and did
      not desire to fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love had usually been to him a richly flowing well-spring of gay delight,
      but this bond had plunged him from one vexation into another, one anxiety
      to another, and now that he had almost reached the goal of his wishes, he
      could not help fearing that he had transformed Ledscha&rsquo;s love to hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne was dear to him. He esteemed her highly, and owed her a great debt
      of gratitude. Yet in this hour he anathematized her unexpected journey to
      Tennis; for without it he would have obtained from Ledscha that very day
      what he desired, and could have returned to Alexandria with the certainty
      of finding her ready later to pose as the model for his Arachne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never could he find anywhere a more fitting one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had devoted himself with passionate love to his art, and even his
      enemies numbered him among its most promising disciples. Yet hither to he
      had not succeeded in obtaining a great and undisputed success. On the
      other hand, he had experienced what were termed failures in abundant
      measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art to which he had gained entrance by so severe a struggle, and on
      whose soil he had laboured diligently enough, proved, so far as outward
      recognition was concerned, cruel to the enthusiastic disciple. Yet even
      now he would not have abandoned it at any price; the joy of creation
      compensated him richly for suffering and disappointment. Confidence in his
      own powers and the final triumph of his conviction had deserted him only
      occasionally, and for a few brief hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born for conflicts. What ill-success, what antagonism and
      difficulties he had encountered! Some day the laurel which had so long
      adorned the brow of Myrtilus must also grow green for him and the great
      talent whose possession he felt. With the Arachne&mdash;he was sure of
      this&mdash;he would compel even his opponents to accord him the
      recognition for which hitherto he had striven in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      While pacing restlessly up and down the spacious apartment, stopping from
      time to time before his work to fix his eyes angrily upon it, he thought
      of his friend&rsquo;s Demeter, whose head also had Daphne&rsquo;s features, who also
      bore in her hand a bundle of wheat, and even in attitude did not differ
      very widely from his own. And yet&mdash;eternal gods!&mdash;how thoroughly
      dissimilar the two were!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the figure created by Myrtilus, supernatural dignity blended with the
      utmost womanly charm; in his, a pleasing head rested upon a body in whose
      formation he had used various models without striving to accomplish
      anything except to depart as far as possible from established custom, with
      which he was at variance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet had he not found himself, nevertheless, compelled to follow the old
      rules? One arm was raised, the other hung down; the right foot was put
      forward, the left one back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly the same as in Myrtilus&rsquo;s statue, and thousands of other figures
      of Demeter!
    </p>
    <p>
      If he could have used the hammer and chisel, the thing might have become
      more powerful; but how many things he had had to consider in employing the
      accursed gold and ivory upon which Archias obstinately insisted!
    </p>
    <p>
      This hammering, chipping, and filing told unfavourably upon his power and
      his aspiration toward grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the battle seemed to be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate that the conqueror was no other than Myrtilus. Often as
      he had gone astray in his young life, many as were the errors he had
      committed, not even the faintest shadow of an envious feeling concerning
      his friend&rsquo;s more successful work had ever stained his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, the fact that fate, in addition to such abundant gifts of mind and
      spirit, had also endowed the latter with great worldly possessions, while
      he, but for the generosity of his uncle Archias, must have starved, had
      often led Hermon to inveigh angrily against the injustice of the gods. Yet
      he did not grudge Myrtilus the wealth without which he could not imagine
      him, and which his invalid friend needed to continue successfully the
      struggle against the insidious disease inherited with the gold. And his
      sufferings! Hermon could not have endured keener pain had they been his
      own. He must even rejoice over the poor dear fellow&rsquo;s victory; for if he,
      Hermon, succeeded with his Arachne as he hoped, it would make Myrtilus&mdash;he
      could swear to it&mdash;happier than his own triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these reflections, which again reminded him of the second
      appointment and of Ledscha, the sculptor turned away from his work and
      went to the window to look across at Pelican Island, where she must not
      await him in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat which was to convey him over to it lay ready in the little
      flotilla, where a magnificently equipped galley had just been moored to
      the shore, undoubtedly the one that had brought the guests from Pelusium
      hither. The best thing he could do was to greet them at once, share the
      banquet with them, and, before the dessert was served, seek the beautiful
      woman whom his absence threatened to make his foe. And she was certainly
      justified in resenting it if, with cruel lack of consideration, he paid no
      heed to what had been prophesied for her on this night of the full moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time compassion mingled with his feelings for Ledscha. If to
      avoid the fleeting censure of aristocratic friends he left in the lurch
      the simple barbarian maiden who loved him with ardent passion, it was no
      evidence of resolute strength of soul, but of pitiful, reprehensible
      weakness. No, no! He must take the nocturnal voyage in order not to grieve
      Ledscha.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the girl&rsquo;s abrupt departure he dressed himself in festal
      garments for the banquet. It would flatter Ledscha also if he went to her
      in this attire and, with his figure drawn up to its full height, he walked
      toward the door to go to the Alexandrian&rsquo;s tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did this mean? Myrtilus was standing before his Demeter, scanning
      it intently with his keen artist eyes. Hermon had not noticed his
      entrance, and did not disturb him now, but fixed his gaze upon his mobile
      features in intense expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were few of his fellow-artists whose opinion he valued as highly as
      that of this darling of the Muse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a slight shake of the head, which Hermon interpreted as disapproval, he
      clinched his teeth; but soon his lips relaxed and his breast heaved with a
      sigh of relief, for the sunny glance that Myrtilus bent upon the face of
      the goddess seemed to show Hermon that it aroused his approval, and, as if
      relieved from an oppressive nightmare, he approached his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter turned toward him, exclaiming: &ldquo;Daphne! As in the case of
      yonder bust, you have succeeded most perfectly with this dear face&mdash;only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; Hermon repeated slowly; &ldquo;I am familiar with that evil word. Doubts
      knock at the door with it. Out with them honestly. I gave up my last hope
      of the prize yesterday while looking at your Demeter. Besides, careful
      scrutiny has just destroyed the last gleam of satisfaction with my own
      work. But if you like the head, what seem to you the greatest defects in
      the figure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has nothing to do with defects, which, with your rare ability, can
      scarcely exist,&rdquo; replied the other, the faint pink flush in his beardless
      cheeks deepening to a more vivid hue. &ldquo;It refers rather to the expression
      which you have given the divinity in yonder statue.&rdquo; Here Myrtilus
      hesitated, and, turning so that he stood face to face with Hermon, asked
      frankly, &ldquo;Did you ever seek the goddess and, when you found her, did you
      feel any supernatural power and beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question!&rdquo; exclaimed Hermon in astonishment. &ldquo;A pupil of Straton,
      and go in search of beings and powers whose existence he denies! What my
      mother instilled into my heart I lost with my childhood, and you address
      your question only to the artist who holds his own ground, not to the boy.
      The power that calls creation to life, and maintains it, has for me long
      had nothing in common with those beings like mortals whom the multitude
      designates by the name of divinities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think differently,&rdquo; replied Myrtilus. &ldquo;While I numbered myself among
      the Epicureans, whose doctrine still possesses the greatest charm for me,
      I nevertheless shared the master&rsquo;s opinion that it is insulting the gods
      to suppose that they will disturb their blissful repose for the sake of us
      insignificant mortals. Now my mind and my experience rebel against holding
      to this view, yet I believe with Epicurus, and with you, that the eternal
      laws of Nature bow to neither divine nor human will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Hermon, &ldquo;you expect me to trouble myself about those who
      are as powerless as myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wished that you might do so,&rdquo; answered Myrtilus; &ldquo;for they are not
      powerless to those who from the first assumed that they can do nothing in
      opposition to those changeless laws. The state, too, rules according to
      them, and the wise king who refrains from interfering with them in the
      smallest trifle can therefore wield the sceptre with mighty power. So, in
      my opinion, it is perfectly allowable to expect aid from the gods. But we
      will let that pass. A healthy man, full of exuberant vigour like yourself,
      rarely learns early what they can bestow in suffering and misfortune; yet
      where the great majority believe in them, he, too, will be unable to help
      forming some idea of them; nay, even you and I have experienced it. By a
      thousand phenomena they force themselves into the world which surrounds us
      and our emotional life. Epicurus, who denied their power, saw in them at
      least immortal beings who possess in stainless perfection everything which
      in mortals is disfigured by errors, weaknesses, and afflictions. To him
      they are the intensified, reflected image of our own nature, and I think
      we can do nothing wiser than to cling to that, because it shows us to what
      heights of beauty and power, intellect, goodness, and purity we may
      attain. To completely deny their existence would hardly be possible even
      for you, because their persons have found a place in your imagination.
      Since this is the case, it can only benefit you to recognise in them
      magnificent models, by whose means we artists, if we imitate, perfect, and
      model them, will create works far more sublime and beautiful than anything
      visible to our senses which we meet here beneath the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is this very superiority in sublimity and beauty which I, and those
      who pursue the same path with me, oppose,&rdquo; replied Hermon. &ldquo;Nature is
      sufficient for us. To take anything from her, mutilates; to add anything,
      disfigures her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not,&rdquo; replied Myrtilus firmly, &ldquo;when it is done only in a special
      sense, and within the limits of Nature, to which the gods also belong. The
      final task of art, fiercely as you and your few followers contend against
      it, lies in the disentanglement, enhancing, and ennobling of Nature. You,
      too, ought not to overlook it when you undertake to model a Demeter; for
      she is a goddess, no mortal like yourself. The rest or I ought rather to
      say the alteration which converts the mortal woman into the immortal one,
      the goddess&mdash;I miss, and with special regret, because you do not even
      deem it worth consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall never do,&rdquo; retorted Hermon irritably, &ldquo;so long as it is a
      changing chimera which presents itself differently to every mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, should it really be a chimera, it is at any rate a sublime one,&rdquo;
       Myrtilus protested, &ldquo;and whoever among us artists wanders through Nature
      with open eyes and heart, and then examines his own soul, will find it
      worth while to attempt to give his ideal form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever stirs my breast during such walks, unless it is some unusual
      human being, I leave to the poet,&rdquo; replied Hermon. &ldquo;I should be satisfied
      with the Demeter yonder, and you, too, probably, if&mdash;entirely apart
      from that&mdash;I had only succeeded fully and entirely in making her an
      individual&mdash;that is, a clearly outlined, distinct personality. This,
      you have often told me, is just wherein I am usually most successful. But
      here, I admit, I am baffled. Demeter hovered before me as a kindly
      dispenser of good gifts, a faithful, loving wife. Daphne&rsquo;s head expresses
      this; but in modelling the body I lost sight of the whole creation. While,
      for instance, in my fig-eater, every toe, every scrap of the tattered
      garments, belongs to the street urchin whom I wished to represent, in the
      goddess everything came by chance as the model suggested it, and you know
      that I used several. Had the Demeter from head to foot resembled Daphne,
      who has so much in common with our goddess, the statue would have been
      harmonious, complete, and you would perhaps have been the first to
      acknowledge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; Myrtilus eagerly interrupted. &ldquo;What our statues of the gods
      are we two know best: a wooden block, covered with gold and sheets of
      ivory. But to tens of thousands the statue of the divinity must be much
      more. When they raise their hearts, eyes, hands to it in prayer, they must
      be possessed by the idea of the deity which animated us while creating it,
      and with which we, as it were, permeated it. If it shows them only a woman
      endowed with praiseworthy qualities&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; interrupted Hermon, &ldquo;the worshipper should thank the sculptor; for
      is it not more profitable to him to be encouraged by the statue to emulate
      the human virtues whose successful embodiment it shows him than to strive
      for the aid of the botchwork of human hands, which possesses as much or as
      little power as the wood, gold, and ivory that compose it? If the
      worshipper does not appeal to the statue, but to the goddess, I fear it
      will be no less futile. So I shall consider it no blemish if you see in my
      Demeter a mortal woman, and no goddess; nay, it reconciles me in some
      degree to her weaknesses, to which I by no means close my eyes. I, too&mdash;I
      confess it&mdash;often feel a great desire to give the power of
      imagination greater play, and I know the divinities in whom I have lost
      faith as well as any one; for I, too, was once a child, and few have ever
      prayed to them more fervently, but with the increasing impulse toward
      liberty came the perception: There are no gods, and whoever bows to the
      power of the immortals makes himself a slave. So what I banished from life
      I will also remove from art, and model nothing which might not meet me
      to-day or to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, as an honest man, abstain altogether from making statues of the
      gods,&rdquo; interrupted his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my intention long ago, as you are aware,&rdquo; the other answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not commit a worse robbery upon yourself,&rdquo; cried Myrtilus. &ldquo;I
      know you; nay, perhaps I see farther into your soul than you yourself. By
      ingenious fetters you force the mighty winged intellect to content itself
      within the narrow world of reality. But the time when you will yourself
      rend the bonds and find the divinity you have lost, will come, and then,
      with your mighty power once more free, you will outstrip most of us, and
      me also if I live to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he pressed his hand upon his rattling chest and walked slowly to the
      couch; but Hermon followed, helped him to lie down, and with affectionate
      solicitude arranged his pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; Myrtilus said soothingly, after a few minutes&rsquo; silence.
      &ldquo;My undermined strength has been heavily taxed to-day. The Olympians know
      how calmly I await death. It ends all things. Nothing will be left of me
      except the ashes, to which you will reduce my body, and what you call
      &lsquo;possession.&rsquo; But even this can no longer belong to me after death,
      because I shall then be no more, and the idea of possession requires a
      possessor. My estate, too, is now disposed of. I have just been to the
      notary, and sixteen witnesses&mdash;neither more nor less&mdash;have
      signed my will according to the custom of this ceremonious country. There,
      now, if you please, go before me, and let me stay here alone a little
      while. Remember me to Daphne and the Pelusinians. I will join you in an
      hour.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the moon is over Pelican Island.&rdquo; How often Ledscha had repeated
      this sentence to herself while Hermon was detained by Daphne and her
      Pelusinian guests!
    </p>
    <p>
      When she entered the boat after nightfall she exclaimed hopefully, sure of
      her cause, &ldquo;When the moon is over Pelican Island he will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her goal was quickly reached in the skiff; the place selected for the
      nocturnal meeting was a familiar one to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirates had remained absent from it quite two years. Formerly they had
      often visited the spot to conceal their arms and booty on the densely
      wooded island. The large papyrus thicket on the shore also hid boats from
      spying eyes, and near the spot where Ledscha landed was a grassy seat
      which looked like an ordinary resting place, but beneath it the corsairs
      had built a long, walled passage, that led to the other side of the
      island, and had enabled many a fugitive to vanish from the sight of
      pursuers, as though the earth had swallowed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the moon is over the island,&rdquo; Ledscha repeated after she had waited
      more than an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had not yet come; the expanse of water lay before her motionless,
      in hue a dull, leaden gray, and only the dimly illumined air and a
      glimmering radiance along the edges of the waves that washed the island
      showed that the moon was already brightening the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When its full orb floated above the island Hermon, too, would appear, and
      the happiness which had been predicted to Ledscha would begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happiness?
    </p>
    <p>
      A bitter smile hovered around her delicately cut lips as she repeated the
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto no feeling was more distant from her; for when love and longing
      began to stir in her heart, it seemed as though a hideous spider was
      weaving its web about her, and vague fears, painful memories, and in their
      train fierce hate would force glad expectation into the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she yearned with passionate fervour to see Hermon again, and when he
      was once there all must be well between them. The prediction of old Tabus,
      who ruled as mistress over so many demons, could not deceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Ledscha had so lately reminded the lover who so vehemently roused
      her jealous wrath what this night of the full moon meant to her, she could
      rely upon his appearance in spite of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various matters undoubtedly held him firmly enough in Tennis&mdash;she
      admitted this to herself after she grew calmer&mdash;but he had promised
      to come; he would surely enter the boat, and she&mdash;she would submit to
      share the night with the Hellene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her whole being longed for the bliss awaiting her, and it could come from
      no one save the man whose lips would seek hers when the moon rose over the
      Pelican Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      How tardily and sluggishly the cow-headed goddess who bore the silver orb
      between her horns rose to-night! how slowly the time passed, yet she did
      not move forward more certainly that the man whom Ledscha expected must
      arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the possibility of his non-appearance she would not think; but when the
      fear that she was perhaps looking for him in vain assailed her, the blood
      crimsoned her face as if she felt the shame of a humiliating insult. Yet
      why should she make the period of waiting more torturing than it was
      already?
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely he must come!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she rested on the grassy seat and gazed across the dull gray
      surface of the water into the distance; sometimes she walked to and fro,
      stopping at every turn to look across at Tennis and the bright torches and
      lights which surrounded the Alexandrian&rsquo;s tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one quarter of an hour after another passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light breeze rose, and gradually the tops of the rushes began to shine,
      and the leafage before, beside, and above her to glitter in the silvery
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water was no longer calm, but furrowed by countless little ripples, on
      whose crests the rays from above played, sparkling and flashing
      restlessly. A web of shimmering silvery radiance covered the edges of
      every island, and suddenly the brilliant full moon was reflected in argent
      lustre like a magnificent quivering column upon the surface of the water,
      now rippled by the evening breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time during which Ledscha could repeat &ldquo;When the moon is over Pelican
      Island&rdquo; was past; already its course had led it beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The island lay behind it, and it continued its pilgrimage before the young
      girl&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glittering column of light upon the water proved that she was not
      mistaken; the time which she had appointed for Hermon had already expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon in calm majesty sailed farther and farther onward in its course,
      and with it minute after minute elapsed, until they became a half hour,
      then a whole one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is it since the moon was over Pelican Island?&rdquo; was the question
      which now pressed itself upon her again and again, and to which she found
      an answer at every glance upward, for she had learned to estimate time by
      the position of the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rarely was the silence of the night interrupted by the call of a human
      being or the barking of a dog from the city, or even the hooting of an owl
      at a still greater distance; but the farther the moon moved on above her
      the fiercer grew the uproar in Ledscha&rsquo;s proud, cruelly wronged soul. She
      felt offended, scorned, insulted, and at the same time defrauded of the
      happiness which this night of the full moon contained for her. Or had the
      demons who promised happiness meant something else in their prediction
      than Hermon&rsquo;s love? Was she to owe the bliss they had foretold to hate and
      pitiless retribution?
    </p>
    <p>
      When the midnight hour had nearly arrived she prepared to depart, but
      after she had already set her foot on the edge of the boat she returned to
      the grassy seat. She would wait a little longer yet. Then there would be
      nothing which could give Hermon a right to consideration; then she might
      let loose upon him the avenging powers at her command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha again gazed over the calm landscape, but in the wild tumult of her
      heart she no longer distinguished the details upon which her eyes rested.
      Doubtless she saw the light mists hovering like ghosts, or the restless
      shades of the unburied dead, over the shining expanse before her, and the
      filmy vapours that veiled the brightness of the stars, but she had ceased
      to question the heavenly bodies about the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did she care for the progress of the hours, since the constellation
      of Charles&rsquo;s Wain showed her that it was past midnight?
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon no longer stood forth in sharp outlines against the deep azure of
      the vaulted sky, but, robbed of its radiance, floated in a circle of dimly
      illumined mists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only the feelings which stirred Ledscha&rsquo;s soul, but the scene around
      her, had gained a totally different aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since every hope of the happiness awaiting her was destroyed, she no
      longer sought to palliate the wrongs Hermon had inflicted upon her. While
      dwelling on them, she by no means forgot the trivial purpose for which the
      artist intended to use her charms; and when she again gazed up at the
      slightly-clouded sky, the shrouded moon no longer reminded her of the
      silver orb between the horns of Astarte.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not ask herself how the transformation had occurred, but in its
      place, high above her head, hung a huge gray spider. Its gigantic limbs
      extended over the whole firmament, and seemed striving to clutch and
      stifle the world beneath. The enormous monster was weaving its gray net
      over Tennis, and all the islands in the water, the Pelican Island, and she
      herself upon the seat of turf, and held them all prisoned in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a horrible vision, fraught with terrors which, even when she shut
      her eyes in order to escape it, showed very little change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assailed by anxious fears, Ledscha started up, and a few seconds later was
      urging her boat with steady strokes toward the Owl&rsquo;s Nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now lights were still shining from the Alexandrian&rsquo;s tent through the
      sultry, veiled night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be no waking life on the pirates&rsquo; island. Even old Tabus
      had probably put out the fire and gone to sleep, for deathlike silence and
      deep darkness surrounded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Hanno, who agreed to meet her here after midnight, also failed to
      come? Had the pirate learned, like the Greek, to break his promise?
    </p>
    <p>
      Only half conscious what she was doing, she left the boat; but her slender
      foot had scarcely touched the land when a tall figure emerged from the
      thicket near the shore and approached her through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hanno!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as if relieved from a burden, and the young pirate
      repeated &ldquo;Hanno&rdquo; as if the name was the watchword of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own name, uttered in a tone of intense yearning, followed. Not another
      syllable accompanied it, but the expression with which it fell upon her
      ear revealed so plainly what the young pirate felt for and expected from
      her that, in spite of the darkness which concealed her, she felt her face
      flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tried to clasp her hand, and she dared not withdraw it from the
      man whom she had chosen for her tool. So she unresistingly permitted him
      to hold her right hand while he whispered his desire to take the place of
      the fallen Abus and make her his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha, in hurried, embarrassed tones, answered that she appreciated the
      honour of his suit, but before she gave full consent she must discuss an
      important matter with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hanno begged her to go out on the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father and his brother Labaja were sitting in the house by the fire
      with his grandmother. They had learned, in following the trade of piracy,
      to hide the glimmer of lights. The old people had approved his choice, but
      the conversation in the dwelling would soon be over, and then the
      opportunity of seeing each other alone would be at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without uttering a word in reply, Ledscha stepped back into the boat, but
      Hanno plied the oars with the utmost caution and guided the skiff without
      the slightest sound away from the island to an open part of the water far
      distant from any shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he took in the oars and asked her to speak. They had no cause to fear
      being overheard, for the surrounding mists merely subdued the light of the
      full moon, and no other boat could have approached them unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few night birds, sweeping swiftly on their strong pinions from one
      island to another, flew past them like flitting shadows. One hawk only, in
      search of nocturnal booty, circled around the motionless skiff, and
      sometimes, with expanded wings, swooped down close to the couple who were
      talking together so eagerly; but both spoke so low that it would have been
      impossible, even for the bird&rsquo;s keen hearing, to follow the course of
      their consultation. Merely a few louder words and exclamations reached the
      height where it hovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young pirate himself was obliged to listen with the most strained
      attention while Ledscha, in low whispers, accused the Greek sculptor of
      having basely wronged and deceived her; but the curse with which Hanno
      received this acknowledgment reached even the bird circling around the
      boat, and it seemed as if it wished to express its approval to the
      corsair, for this time its fierce croak, as it suddenly swooped down to
      the surface of the water behind the boat, sounded shrilly through the
      silent night. But it soon soared again, and now Ledscha&rsquo;s declaration that
      she would become Hanno&rsquo;s bride only on condition that he would aid her to
      punish the Hellenic traitor also reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the words &ldquo;valuable booty,&rdquo; &ldquo;slight risk,&rdquo; &ldquo;thanks and reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s whispered allusion to two colossal statues made of pure gold
      and genuine ivory was followed by a laugh of disagreeable meaning from the
      pirate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he raised his deep voice to ask whether Ledscha, if the venture in
      which he would willingly risk his life were successful, would accompany
      him on board the Hydra, the good ship whose command his father intrusted
      to him. The firm &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with which she answered, and her indignant
      exclamation as she repulsed Hanno&rsquo;s premature attempt at tenderness, might
      have been heard by the hawk even at a greater distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the pirate&rsquo;s promised bride lowered her voice again, and did not
      raise her tones until she saw in imagination the fulfilment of the
      judgment which she was calling down upon the man who had torn her heart
      with such pitiless cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this the happiness predicted for her on the night of the full moon? It
      might be, and, radiant with secret joy, her eyes sparkling and her bosom
      heaving as if her foot was already on the breast of the fallen foe, she
      assured Hanno that the gold and the ivory should belong to him, and to him
      alone; but not until he had delivered the base traitor to her alive, and
      left his punishment in her hands, would she be ready to go with him
      wherever he wished&mdash;not until then, and not one moment earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirate, with a proud &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll capture him!&rdquo; consented to this condition;
      but Ledscha, in hurried words, now described how she had planned the
      attack, while the corsair, at her bidding, plied the oars so as to bring
      the boat nearer to the scene of the assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vulture followed the skiff; but when it stopped opposite to the large
      white building, one side of which was washed by the waves, Ledscha pointed
      to the windows of Hermon&rsquo;s studio, exclaiming hoarsely to the young
      pirate: &ldquo;You will seize him there&mdash;the Greek with the long, soft
      black beard, and the slender figure, I mean. Then you will bind and gag
      him, but, you hear, without killing him, for I can only inflict what he
      deserves upon the living man. I am not bargaining for a dead one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just at that instant the bird of prey, with a shrill, greedy cry, as if it
      were invited to a delicious banquet, flew far away into the distance and
      did not return. It flew toward the left; the girl noticed it, and her
      heavy black eyebrows, which already met, contracted still more. The
      direction taken by the bird, which soon vanished in the darkness of the
      night, indicated approaching misfortune; but she was here only to sow
      destruction, and the more terrible growth it attained the better!
    </p>
    <p>
      With an acuteness which aroused the admiration of the young corsair, who
      was trained to similar plots, she explained hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      That they must wait until after the departure of the Alexandrian with her
      numerous train, and for the first dark night, was a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      One signal was to notify Hanno to hold himself in readiness, another to
      inform him that every one in the white house had gone to rest, and that
      Hermon was there too. The pirates were to enter the black-bearded Greek&rsquo;s
      studio. While some were shattering his statues to carry away in sacks the
      gold and ivory which they contained, others were to force their way into
      Myrtilus&rsquo;s workroom, which was on the opposite side of the house. There
      they would find the second statue; but this they must spare, because, on
      account of the great fame of its creator, it was more valuable than the
      other. The fair-haired artist was ill, and it would be no difficult matter
      to take him alive, even if he should put himself on the defensive. Hermon,
      on the contrary, was a strong fellow, and to bind him without injuring him
      severely would require both strength and skill. Yet it must be done, for
      only in case Hanno succeeded in delivering both sculptors to her alive
      would she consider herself&mdash;she could not repeat it often enough&mdash;bound
      to fulfil what she had promised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of the two artists, only Myrtilus&rsquo;s servant, the old
      doorkeeper, and Bias, Hermon&rsquo;s slave, remained during the night in the
      house which was to be attacked, and Hanno would undertake the assault with
      twenty-five sturdy fellows whom he commanded on the Hydra if his brother
      Labaja consented to share in the assault, this force could be considerably
      increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take the old corsair into their confidence now would not be advisable,
      for, on account of his mother&rsquo;s near presence, he would scarcely consent
      to enter into the peril. Should the venture fail, everything would be
      over; but if it succeeded, the old man could only praise the courage and
      skill with which it had been executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was to be feared from the coast guard, for since Abus&rsquo;s death the
      authorities believed that piracy had vanished from these waters, and the
      ships commanded by Satabus and his sons had been admitted from Pontus into
      the Tanite arm of the Nile as trading vessels.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Hanno was discussing these considerations, he rowed the boat past
      the landing place from which the &ldquo;garden&rdquo; with the Alexandrian&rsquo;s tent
      could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third hour after midnight had begun. Smoking flames were still rising
      from the pitch pans and blazing torches, and long rows of lanterns also
      illumined the broad space.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as light as day in the vicinity of the tent, and Biamite huntsmen
      and traders were moving to and fro among the slaves and attendants as
      though it was market time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father, too,&rdquo; Hanno remarked in his awkward fashion, &ldquo;will scarcely
      make life hard for us. We shall probably find him in Pontus. He is getting
      a cargo of wood for Egypt there. We have had dealings with him a long
      time. He thought highly of Abus, and I, too, have already been useful to
      him. There were handsome young fellows on the Pontine coast, and we
      captured them. At the peril of our lives we took them to the mart. He may
      even risk it in Alexandria. So the old man makes over to him a large
      number of these youths, and often a girl into the bargain, and he does it
      far too cheaply. One might envy him the profit&mdash;if it were not your
      father! When you are once my wife, I&rsquo;ll make a special contract with him
      about the slaves. And, besides, since the last great capture, in which the
      old man allowed me a share of my own, I, too, need not complain of
      poverty. I shall be ready for the dowry. Do you want to know what you are
      worth to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ledscha&rsquo;s attention was attracted by other things, and even after
      Hanno, with proud conceit, repeated his momentous question, he waited in
      vain for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he perceived that the girl was gazing at the brilliantly lighted
      square as if spellbound, and now he himself saw before the tent a shed
      with a canopied roof, and beneath it cushioned couches, on which several
      Greeks&mdash;men and women&mdash;were half sitting, half lying, watching
      with eager attention the spectacle which a slender young Hellenic woman
      was presenting to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall man with the magnificent black beard, who seemed fairly devouring
      her with his eyes, must be the sculptor whom Ledscha commanded him to
      capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the rude pirate the Greek girl, who in a light, half-transparent bombyx
      robe, was exhibiting herself to the eyes of the men upon a pedestal draped
      with cloths, seemed bold and shameless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind her stood two female attendants, holding soft white garments ready,
      and a handsome Pontine boy with black, waving locks, who gazed up at her
      waiting for her signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearer,&rdquo; Ledscha ordered the pirate in a stifled voice, and he rowed the
      boat noiselessly under the shadow of a willow on the bank. But the skiff
      had scarcely been brought to a stop there when an elderly matron, who
      shared the couch of an old Macedonian man of a distinguished, soldierly
      appearance, called the name &ldquo;Niobe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Hellene on the pedestal took a cloth from the hand of one of the
      female attendants, and beckoned to the boy, who obediently drew through
      his girdle the short blue chiton which hung only to his knees, and sprang
      upon the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the Greek girl manipulated in some way the red tresses piled high
      upon her head, and confined above the brow by a costly gold diadem, flung
      the white linen fabric which the young slave handed to her over her head,
      wound her arm around the shoulders of the raven-locked boy, and drew him
      toward her with passionate tenderness. At the same time she raised the end
      of the linen drapery with her left hand, spreading it over him like a
      protecting canopy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mobile features which had just smiled so radiantly expressed mortal
      terror, and the pirate, to whom even the name &ldquo;Niobe&rdquo; was unfamiliar,
      looked around him for the terrible danger threatening the innocent child,
      from which the woman on the pedestal was protecting it with loving
      devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mortal terror of a mother robbed by a higher power of her child could
      scarcely be more vividly depicted, and yet haughty defiance hovered around
      her slightly pouting lips; the uplifted hands seemed not only anxiously to
      defend, but also to defy an invisible foe with powerless anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirate&rsquo;s eyes rested on this spectacle as if spellbound, and the man
      who in Pontus had dragged hundreds of young creatures&mdash;boys and girls&mdash;on
      his ship to sell them into slavery, never thinking of the tears which he
      thereby caused in huts and mansions, clinched his rough hand to attack the
      base wretch who was robbing the poor mother of her lovely darling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just as Hanno was rising to look around him for the invisible
      evildoer, the loud shouts of many voices startled him. He glanced toward
      the pedestal; but now, instead of the hapless mother, he found there the
      bold woman whom he had previously seen, as radiant as if some great piece
      of good fortune had befallen her, bowing and waving her hand to the other
      Greeks, who were thanking her with loud applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sorely threatened boy, bowing merrily, sprang to the ground; but Hanno
      put his hand on Ledscha&rsquo;s arm, and in great perplexity whispered, &ldquo;What
      did that mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the girl softly, stretching her slender neck toward the
      illuminated square, for the performer had remained standing upon the
      pedestal, and Chrysilla, Daphne&rsquo;s companion, sat erect on her couch,
      exclaiming, &ldquo;If it is agreeable to you, beautiful Althea, show us Nike
      crowning the victor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the Biamite&rsquo;s keen ear could not catch the reply and the purport of
      the rapid conversation which followed; but she guessed the point in
      question when the young men who were present rose hastily, rushed toward
      the pedestal, loosed the wreaths from their heads, and offered them to the
      Greek girl whom Chrysilla had just called &ldquo;beautiful Althea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four Hellenic officers in the strong military force under Philippus, the
      commandant of the &ldquo;Key of Egypt,&rdquo; as Pelusium was justly called, had
      accompanied the old Macedonian general to visit his friend Archias&rsquo;s
      daughter at Tennis; but Althea rejected their garlands with an explanation
      which seemed to satisfy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha could not hear what she said, but when only Hermon and Myrtilus
      still stood with their wreaths of flowers opposite the &ldquo;beautiful Althea,&rdquo;
       and she glanced hesitatingly from one to the other, as if she found the
      choice difficult, and then drew from her finger a sparkling ring, the
      Biamite detected the swift look of understanding which Hermon exchanged
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s heart began to throb faster, and, with the keen premonition of
      a jealous soul, she recognised in Althea her rival and foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was no doubt of it; now, as the actress, skilled in every wile,
      hid the hand holding the ring, as well as the other empty one, behind her
      back, she would know how to manage so that she could use the garland which
      Hermon handed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha&rsquo;s foreboding was instantly fulfilled, for when Althea held out her
      little tightly clinched fist to the artists and asked Myrtilus to choose,
      the hand to which he pointed and she then opened was empty, and she took
      from the other the ring, which she displayed with well-feigned regret to
      the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hermon knelt before her, and, as he offered Althea his wreath, his
      dark eyes gazed so ardently into the blue ones of the red-haired
      Greek-like Queen Arsinoe, she was of Thracian descent&mdash;that Ledscha
      was now positively certain she knew for whose sake her lover had so basely
      betrayed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      How she hated this bold woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she was forced to keep quiet, and pressed her lips tightly together as
      Althea seized the white sheet and with marvellous celerity wound it about
      her until it fell in exquisite folds like a long robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise, curiosity, and a pleasant sense of satisfaction in seeing what
      seemed to her a shameless display withdrawn from her lover&rsquo;s eyes,
      rendered it easier for Ledscha to maintain her composure; yet she felt the
      blood throbbing in her temples as Hermon remained kneeling before the
      Hellene, gazing intently into her expressive face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it not too narrow wholly to please the man who had known how to praise
      her own beauty so passionately? Did not the outlines of Althea&rsquo;s figure,
      which the bombyx robe only partially concealed, lack roundness even more
      than her own?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet! As soon as Althea had transformed the sheet into a robe, and held
      the wreath above him, Hermon&rsquo;s gaze rested on hers as though enraptured,
      while from her bright blue eyes a flood of ardent admiration poured upon
      the man for whom she held the victor&rsquo;s wreath.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done with the upper portion of her body bending very far forward.
      The slender figure was poised on one foot; the other, covered to the ankle
      with the long robe, hovered in the air. Had not the wings which, as Nike,
      belonged to her been lacking, every one would have been convinced that she
      was flying&mdash;that she had just descended from the heights of Olympus
      to crown the kneeling victor. Not only her hand, her gaze and her every
      feature awarded the prize to the man at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt that, if Nike herself came to the earth to make the
      best man happy with the noblest of crowns, the spectacle would be a
      similar one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hermon! No garlanded victor could look up to the gracious divinity
      more joyously, more completely enthralled by grateful rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applause which now rang out more and more loudly was certainly not
      undeserved, but it pierced Ledscha&rsquo;s soul like a mockery, like the
      bitterest scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hanno, on the contrary, seemed to consider the scene scarcely worth
      looking at. Something more powerful was required to stir him. He was
      particularly averse to all exhibitions. The utmost which his relatives
      could induce the quiet, reserved man to do when they ventured into the
      great seaports was to attend the animal fights and the games of the
      athletes. He felt thoroughly happy only when at sea, on board of his good
      ship. His best pleasure was to gaze up at the stars on calm nights, guide
      the helm, and meanwhile dream&mdash;of late most gladly of making the
      beautiful girl who had seemed to him worthy of his brave brother Abus, his
      own wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the secluded monotony of his life as a scar over memory had exalted
      Ledscha into the most desirable of all women, and the slaughtered Abus
      into the greatest of heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To win the love of this much-praised maiden seemed to Hanno peerless
      happiness, and the young corsair felt that he was worthy of it; for on the
      high seas, when a superior foe was to be opposed by force and stratagem,
      when a ship was to be boarded and death spread over her deck, he had
      proved himself a man of unflinching courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      His suit had progressed more easily than he expected. His father would
      rejoice, and his heart exulted at the thought of encountering a serious
      peril for the girl he loved. His whole existence was a venture of life,
      and, had he had ten to lose, they would not have been too dear a price to
      him to win Ledscha.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Althea, as the goddess of Victory, held the wreath aloft, and loud
      applause hailed her, Hanno was thinking of the treasures which he had
      garnered since his father had allowed him a share of the booty, and of the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had accumulated ten talents of gold he would give up piracy, like
      Abus, and carry on his own ships wood and slaves from Pontus to Egypt, and
      textiles from Tennis, arms and other manufactured articles from Alexandria
      to the Pontine cities. In this way Ledscha&rsquo;s father had become a rich man,
      and he would also, not for his own sake&mdash;he needed little&mdash;but
      to make life sweet for his wife, surround her with splendour and luxury,
      and adorn her beautiful person with costly jewels. Many a stolen ornament
      was already lying in the safe hiding place that even his brother Labaja
      did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the shouts died away, and as the stopping of the clattering wheel
      wakes the miller, so the stillness on the shore roused Hanno from his
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it that Ledscha saw there so fascinating that she did not even
      hear his low call? His father and Labaja had undoubtedly left his
      grandmother&rsquo;s house long ago, and were looking for him in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he was right; the old pirate&rsquo;s shrill whistle reached his ear from
      the Owl&rsquo;s Nest, and he was accustomed to obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, lightly touching Ledscha on the shoulder, he whispered that he must
      return to the island at once. His father would be rejoiced if she went
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she answered in a tone of resolute denial. Then, reminding
      him once more of the meaning of the signals she had promised to give, she
      waved her hand to him, sprang swiftly past him to the prow of the boat,
      caught an overhanging bough of the willow on the shore, and, as she had
      learned during the games of her childhood, swung herself as lightly as a
      bird into the thicket at the water&rsquo;s edge, which concealed her from every
      eye.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Without even vouchsafing Hanno another glance, Ledscha glided forward in
      the shadow of the bushes to the great sycamore, whose thick, broad top on
      the side toward the tents was striped with light from the flood of
      radiance streaming from them. On the opposite side the leafage vanished in
      the darkness of the night, but Myrtilus had had a bench placed there, that
      he might rest in the shade, and from this spot the girl could obtain the
      best view of what she desired to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      How gay and animated it was under the awning!
    </p>
    <p>
      A throng of companions had arrived with the Pelusinians, and some also had
      probably been on the ship which&mdash;she knew it from Bias&mdash;had come
      to Tennis directly from Alexandria that afternoon. The galley was said to
      belong to Philotas, an aristocratic relative of King Ptolemy. If she was
      not mistaken, he was the stately young Greek who was just picking up the
      ostrich-feather fan that had slipped from Daphne&rsquo;s lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The performance was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young slaves in gay garments, and nimble female servants with glittering
      gold circlets round their upper arms and on their ankles, were passing
      from couch to couch, and from one guest to another, offering refreshments.
      Hermon had risen from his knees, and the wreath of bright flowers again
      adorned his black curls. He held himself as proudly erect as if the
      goddess of Victory herself had crowned him, while Althea was reaping
      applause and thanks. Ledscha gazed past her and the others to watch every
      movement of the sculptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was scarcely the daughter of Archias who had detained Hermon, for he
      made only a brief answer&mdash;Ledscha could not hear what it was&mdash;when
      she accosted him pleasantly, to devote himself to Althea, and&mdash;this
      could be perceived even at a distance&mdash;thank her with ardent
      devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now&mdash;now he even raised the hem of her peplos to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scornful smile hovered around Ledscha&rsquo;s mouth; but Daphne&rsquo;s guests also
      noticed this mark of homage&mdash;an unusual one in their circle&mdash;and
      young Philotas, who had followed Daphne from Alexandria, cast a
      significant glance at a man with a smooth, thin, birdlike face, whose hair
      was already turning gray. His name was Proclus, and, as grammateus of the
      Dionysian games and high priest of Apollo, he was one of the most
      influential men in Alexandria, especially as he was one of the favoured
      courtiers of Queen Arsinoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had gone by her command to the Syrian court, had enjoyed on his return,
      at Pelusium, with his travelling companion Althea, the hospitality of
      Philippus, and accompanied the venerable officer to Tennis in order to win
      him over to certain plans. In spite of his advanced age, he still strove
      to gain the favour of fair women, and the sculptor&rsquo;s excessive ardour had
      displeased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he let his somewhat mocking glance wander from Althea to Hermon, and
      called to the latter: &ldquo;My congratulations, young master; but I need
      scarcely remind you that Nike suffers no one&mdash;not even goodness and
      grace personified&mdash;to take from her hand what it is her sole duty to
      bestow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking he adjusted the laurel on his own thin hair; but Thyone,
      the wife of Philippus, answered eagerly: &ldquo;If I were a young man like
      Hermon, instead of an old woman, noble Proclus, I think the wreath which
      Beauty bestows would render me scarcely less happy than stern Nike&rsquo;s crown
      of victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While making this pleasant reply the matron&rsquo;s wrinkled face wore an
      expression of such cordial kindness, and her deep voice was so winning in
      its melody, that Hermon forced himself to heed the glance of urgent
      warning Daphne cast at him, and leave the sharp retort that hovered on his
      lips unuttered. Turning half to the grammateus, half to the matron, he
      merely said, in a cold, self-conscious tone, that Thyone was right. In
      this gay circle, the wreath of bright flowers proffered by the hands of a
      beautiful woman was the dearest of all gifts, and he would know how to
      value it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until other more precious ones cast it into oblivion,&rdquo; observed Althea.
      &ldquo;Let me see, Hermon: ivy and roses. The former is lasting, but the roses&mdash;&rdquo;
       She shook her finger in roguish menace at the sculptor as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The roses,&rdquo; Proclus broke in again, &ldquo;are of course the most welcome to
      our young friend from such a hand; yet these flowers of the goddess of
      Beauty have little in common with his art, which is hostile to beauty.
      Still, I do not know what wreath will be offered to the new tendency with
      which he surprised us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Hermon raised his head higher, and answered sharply: &ldquo;Doubtless
      there must have been few of them, since you, who are so often among the
      judges, do not know them. At any rate, those which justice bestows have
      hitherto been lacking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should deplore that,&rdquo; replied Proclus, stroking his sharp chin with his
      thumb and forefinger; &ldquo;but I fear that our beautiful Nike also cared
      little for this lofty virtue of the judge in the last coronation. However,
      her immortal model lacks it often enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she is a woman,&rdquo; said one of the young officers, laughing; and
      another added gaily: &ldquo;That very thing may be acceptable to us soldiers.
      For my part, I think everything about the goddess of Victory is beautiful
      and just, that she may remain graciously disposed toward us. Nay, I accuse
      the noble Althea of withholding from Nike, in her personation, her special
      ornament&mdash;her swift, powerful wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave those to Eros, to speed his flight,&rdquo; laughed Proclus, casting a
      meaning look at Althea and Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one failed to notice that this jest alluded to the love which seemed to
      have been awakened in the sculptor as quickly as in the personator of the
      goddess of Victory, and, while it excited the merriment of the others, the
      blood mounted into Hermon&rsquo;s cheeks; but Myrtilus perceived what was
      passing in the mind of his irritable friend, and, as the grammateus
      praised Nike because in this coronation she had omitted the laurel, the
      fair-haired Greek interrupted him with the exclamation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, noble Proclus, the grave laurel does not suit our gay
      pastime; but roses belong to the artist everywhere, and are always welcome
      to him. The more, the better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will wait till the laurel is distributed in some other place,&rdquo;
       replied the grammateus; and Myrtilus quickly added, &ldquo;I will answer for it
      that Hermon does not leave it empty-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one will greet the work which brings your friend the wreath of victory
      with warmer joy,&rdquo; Proclus protested. &ldquo;But, if I am correctly informed,
      yonder house hides completed treasures whose inspection would give the
      fitting consecration to this happy meeting. Do you know what an exquisite
      effect gold and ivory statues produce in a full glow of lamplight? I first
      learned it a short time ago at the court of King Antiochus. There is no
      lack of lights here. What do you say, gentlemen? Will you not have the
      studios lighted till the rooms are as bright as day, and add a noble
      enjoyment of art to the pleasures of this wonderful night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Hermon and Myrtilus opposed this proposal with equal decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their refusal awakened keen regret, and the old commandant of Pelusium
      would not willingly yield to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angrily shaking his large head, around which, in spite of his advanced
      age, thick snowwhite locks floated like a lion&rsquo;s mane, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Must
      we then really return to our Pelusium, where Ares restricts the native
      rights of the Muses, without having admired the noble works which arose in
      such mysterious secrecy here, where Arachne rules and swings the weaver&rsquo;s
      shuttle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my two cruel cousins have closed their doors even upon me, who came
      here for the sake of their works,&rdquo; Daphne interrupted, &ldquo;and, as rather
      Zeus is threatening a storm&mdash;just see what black clouds are rising!&mdash;we
      ought not to urge our artists further; a solemn oath forbids them to show
      their creations now to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This earnest assurance silenced the curious, and, while the conversation
      took another turn, the gray-haired general&rsquo;s wife drew Myrtilus aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon&rsquo;s parents had been intimate friends of her own, as well as of her
      husband&rsquo;s, and with the interest of sincere affection she desired to know
      whether the young sculptor could really hope for the success of which
      Myrtilus had just spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was years since she had visited Alexandria, but what she heard of
      Hermon&rsquo;s artistic work from many guests, and now again through Proclus,
      filled her with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had succeeded, it was said, in attracting attention, and his great
      talent was beyond question; but in this age, to which beauty was as much
      one of the necessities of life as bread and wine, and which could not
      separate it from art, he ventured to deny it recognition. He headed a
      current in art which was striving to destroy what had been proved and
      acknowledged, yet, though his creations were undeniably powerful, and even
      showed many other admirable qualities, instead of pleasing, satisfying,
      and ennobling, they repelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      These opinions had troubled the matron, who understood men, and was the
      more disposed to credit them the more distinctly she perceived traces of
      discontent and instability in Hermon&rsquo;s manner during the present meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it afforded her special pleasure to learn from Myrtilus his firm
      conviction that, in Arachne, Hermon would produce a masterpiece which
      could scarcely be excelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this conversation Althea had come to Thyone&rsquo;s side, and, as Hermon
      had already spoken to her of the Arachne, she eagerly expressed her belief
      that this work seemed as if it were specially created for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greek matron leaned back comfortably upon her cushions, her wrinkled,
      owl-like face assumed a cheerful expression, and, with the easy confidence
      conferred by aristocratic birth, a distinguished social position, and a
      light heart, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Lucifer is probably already behind yonder
      clouds, preparing to announce day, and this exquisite banquet ought to
      have a close worthy of it. What do you say, you wonder-working darling of
      the Muses&rdquo;&mdash;she held out her hand to Althea as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;to
      showing us and the two competing artists yonder the model of the Arachne
      they are to represent in gold and ivory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Althea fixed her eyes upon the ground, and, after a short period of
      reflection, answered hesitatingly: &ldquo;The task which you set before me is
      certainly no easy one, but I shall rely upon your indulgence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will!&rdquo; cried the matron to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, clapping her hands, she continued gaily, in the tone of the director
      of an entertainment issuing invitations to a performance: &ldquo;Your attention
      is requested! In this city of weavers the noble Thracian, Althea, will
      depict before you all the weaver of weavers, Arachne, in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take heed and follow my advice to sharpen your eyes,&rdquo; added Philotas,
      who, conscious of his inferiority in intellect and talents to the men and
      women assembled here, took advantage of this opportunity to assert himself
      in a manner suited to his aristocratic birth. &ldquo;This artistic yet hapless
      Arachne, if any one, teaches the lesson how the lofty Olympians punish
      those who venture to place themselves on the same level; so let artists
      beware. We stepchildren of the Muse can lull ourselves comfortably in the
      assurance of not giving the jealous gods the slightest cause for the doom
      which overtook the pitiable weaver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word of this declaration of the Macedonian aristocrat escaped the
      listening Ledscha. Scales seemed to fall from her eyes. Hermon had won her
      love in order to use her for the model of his statue of Arachne, and, now
      that he had met Althea, who perhaps suited his purpose even better, he no
      longer needed the barbarian. He had cast her aside like a tight shoe as
      soon as he found a more acceptable one in this female juggler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had already asked herself, with a slight thrill of horror,
      whether she had not prematurely called down so terrible a punishment upon
      her lover; now she rejoiced in her swift action. If anything else remained
      for her to do, it was to make the vengeance with which she intended to
      requite him still more severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he stood beside the woman she hated. Could he bestow even one poor
      thought upon the Biamite girl and the wrong he had inflicted?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no! His heart was filled to overflowing by the Greek&mdash;every look
      revealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the shameless creature probably whispering to him now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps a meeting was just being granted. The rapture which had been
      predicted to her for this moonlight night, and of which Hermon had robbed
      her, was mirrored in his features. He could think of everything except her
      and her poor, crushed heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ledscha was mistaken. Althea had asked the sculptor whether he still
      regretted having been detained by her before midnight, and he had
      confessed that his remaining at the banquet had been connected with a
      great sacrifice&mdash;nay, with an offence which weighed heavily on his
      mind. Yet he was grateful to the favour of the gods that had guided his
      decision, for Althea had it in her power to compensate him richly for what
      he had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glance full of promise flashed upon him from her eloquent eyes, and,
      turning toward the pedestal at the same instant, she asked softly, &ldquo;Is the
      compensation I must and will bestow connected with the Arachne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An eager &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; confirmed this question, and a swift movement of her
      expressive lips showed him that his boldest anticipations were to be
      surpassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How gladly he would have detained her longer!&mdash;but she was already
      the object of all eyes, and his, too, followed her in expectant suspense
      as she gave an order to the female attendant and then stood thoughtfully
      for some time before the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she at last ascended it, the spectators supposed that she would again
      use a cloth; but, instead of asking anything more from the assistants, she
      cast aside even the peplos that covered her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, almost lean in her slenderness, she stood with downcast eyes; but
      suddenly she loosed the double chain, adorned with flashing gems, from her
      neck, the circlets from her upper arms and wrists, and, lastly, even the
      diadem, a gift bestowed by her relative, Queen Arsinoe, from her narrow
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The female slaves received them, and then with swift movements Althea
      divided her thick long tresses of red hair into narrower strands, which
      she flung over her back, bosom, and shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, as if delirious, she threw her head so far on one side that it
      almost touched her left shoulder, and stared wildly upward toward the
      right, at the same time raising her bare arms so high that they extended
      far above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was again her purpose to present the appearance of defending herself
      against a viewless power, yet she was wholly unlike the Niobe whom she had
      formerly personated, for not only anguish, horror, and defiance, but deep
      despair and inexpressible astonishment were portrayed by her features,
      which obediently expressed the slightest emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something unprecedented, incomprehensible even to herself, was occurring,
      and to Ledscha, who watched her with an expectation as passionate as if
      her own weal and woe depended upon Althea&rsquo;s every movement, it seemed as
      if an unintelligible marvel was happening before her eyes, and a still
      greater one was impending; for was the woman up there really a woman like
      herself and the others whose eyes were now fixed upon the hated actress no
      less intently than her own?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did her keen senses deceive her, or was not what was occurring actually a
      mysterious transformation?
    </p>
    <p>
      As Althea stood there, her delicate arms seemed to have lengthened and
      lost even their slight roundness, her figure to have become even more
      slender and incorporeal, and how strangely her thin fingers spread apart!
      How stiffly the strands of the parted, wholly uncurled locks stood out in
      the air!
    </p>
    <p>
      Did it not seem as if they were to help her move?
    </p>
    <p>
      The black shadow which Althea&rsquo;s figure and limbs cast upon the surface of
      the brightly lighted pedestal-no, it was no deception, it not only
      resembled the spinner among insects, it presented the exact picture of a
      spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greek&rsquo;s slender body had contracted, her delicate arms and narrow
      braids of hair changed into spider legs, and the many-jointed hands were
      already grasping for their prey like a spider, or preparing to wind the
      murderous threads around another living creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arachne, the spider!&rdquo; fell almost inaudibly from her quivering lips, and,
      overpowered by torturing fear, she was already turning away from the
      frightful image, when the storm of applause which burst from the
      Alexandrian guests soothed her excited imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the spider, a slender, lank woman, with long, outstretched bare
      arms, and fingers spread wide apart, fluttering hair, and wandering eyes
      again stood before Ledscha.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no peace was yet granted to her throbbing heart, for while Althea,
      with perspiring brow and quivering lips, descended from the pedestal, and
      was received with loud demonstrations of astonishment and delight, the
      glare of a flash of lightning burst through the clouds, and a loud peal of
      thunder shook the night air and reverberated a long time over the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant a loud cry rang from beneath the canopy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone, the wife of Alexander the Great&rsquo;s comrade, though absolutely
      fearless in the presence of human foes, dreaded the thunder by which Zeus
      announced his anger. Seized with sudden terror, she commanded a slave to
      obtain a black lamb for a sacrifice, and earnestly entreated her husband
      and her other companions to go on board the ship with her and seek shelter
      in its safe, rain-proof cabin, for already heavy drops were beginning to
      fall upon the tensely drawn awning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nemesis!&rdquo; exclaimed the grammateus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nemesis!&rdquo; whispered young Philotas to Daphne in a confidential murmur,
      throwing his own costly purple cloak around her to shield her from the
      rain. &ldquo;Nowhere that we mortals overstep the bounds allotted to us do we
      await her in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then bending down to her again, he added, by way of explanation: &ldquo;The
      winged daughter of Night would prove herself negligent if she allowed me
      to enjoy wholly without drawback the overwhelming happiness of being with
      you once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nemesis!&rdquo; remarked Thoas, an aristocratic young hipparch of the guards of
      the Diadochi, who had studied in Athens and belonged to the Peripatetics
      there. &ldquo;The master sees in the figure of this goddess the indignation
      which the good fortune of the base or the unworthy use of good fortune
      inspires in us. She keeps the happy mean between envy and malicious
      satisfaction.&rdquo; The young soldier looked around him, expecting applause,
      but no one was listening; the tempest was spreading terror among most of
      the freedmen and slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philotas and Myrtilus were following Daphne and her companion Chrysilla as
      they hurried into the tent. The deep, commanding tones of old Philippus
      vainly shouted the name of Althea, whom, as he had bestowed his
      hospitality upon her in Pelusium, he regarded as his charge, while at
      intervals he reprimanded the black slaves who were to carry his wife to
      the ship, but at another heavy peal of thunder set down the litter to
      throw themselves on their knees and beseech the angry god for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gras, the steward whom Archias had given to his daughter, a Bithynian who
      had attached himself to one school of philosophy after an other, and
      thereby ceased to believe in the power of the Olympians, lost his quiet
      composure in this confusion, and even his usual good nature deserted him.
      With harsh words, and no less harsh blows, he rushed upon the servants,
      who, instead of carrying the costly household utensils and embroidered
      cushions into the tent, drew out their amulets and idols to confide their
      own imperilled lives to the protection of higher powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the gusts of wind which accompanied the outbreak of the storm
      extinguished the lamps and pitch-pans. The awning was torn from the posts,
      and amid the wild confusion rang the commandant of Pelusium&rsquo;s shouts for
      Althea and the screams of two Egyptian slave women, who, with their
      foreheads pressed to the ground, were praying, while the angry Gras was
      trying, by kicks and blows, to compel them to rise and go to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers were holding a whispered consultation whether they should
      accept the invitation of Proclus and spend the short remnant of the night
      on his galley over the wine, or first, according to the counsel of their
      pious commandant, wait in the neighbouring temple of Zeus until the storm
      was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tempest had completely scattered Daphne&rsquo;s guests. Even Ledscha glanced
      very rarely toward the tents. She had thrown her self on the ground under
      the sycamore to beseech the angry deity for mercy, but, deeply as fear
      moved her agitated soul, she could not pray, but listened anxiously
      whenever an unexpected noise came from the meeting place of the Greeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the tones of a familiar voice reached her. It was Hermon&rsquo;s, and the
      person to whom he was speaking could be no one but the uncanny
      spider-woman, Althea.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were coming to have a secret conversation under the shade of the
      dense foliage of the sycamore. That was easily perceived, and in an
      instant Ledscha&rsquo;s fear yielded to a different feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding her breath, she nestled close to the trunk of the ancient tree to
      listen, and the first word she heard was the name &ldquo;Nemesis,&rdquo; which had
      just reached her from the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew its meaning, for Tennis also had a little temple dedicated to the
      terrible goddess, which was visited by the Egyptians and Biamites as well
      as the Greeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A triumphant smile flitted over her unveiled features, for there was no
      other divinity on whose aid she could more confidently rely. She could
      unchain the vengeance which threatened Hermon with a far more terrible
      danger than the thunder clouds above, under the protection&mdash;nay, as
      it were at the behest of Nemesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow she would be the first to anoint her altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she rejoiced that her wealthy father imposed no restriction upon her
      in the management of household affairs, for she need spare no expense in
      choosing the animal she intended to offer as a sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflection flashed through her mind with the speed of lightning while
      she was listening to Althea&rsquo;s conversation with the sculptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question here can be no clever play upon the name and the nature of
      the daughter of Erebus and Night,&rdquo; said the Thracian gravely. &ldquo;I will
      remind you that there is another Nemesis besides the just being who drives
      from his stolen ease the unworthy mortal who suns himself in good fortune.
      The Nemesis whom I will recall to-day, while angry Zeus is hurling his
      thunderbolts, is the other, who chastises sacrilege&mdash;Ate, the
      swiftest and most terrible of the Erinyes. I will invoke her wrath upon
      you in this hour if you do not confess the truth to me fully and
      entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask,&rdquo; Hermon interrupted in a hollow tone. &ldquo;Only, you strange woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; she hastily broke in, &ldquo;whatever the answer may be, I must pose to
      you as the model for your Arachne&mdash;and perhaps it may come to that&mdash;but
      first I must know, briefly and quickly, for they will be looking for me
      immediately. Do you love Daphne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered positively. &ldquo;True, she has been dear to me from
      childhood&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; Althea added, completing the sentence, &ldquo;you owe her father a debt
      of gratitude. But that is not new to me; I know also how little reason you
      gave her for loving you. Yet her heart belongs neither to Philotas, the
      great lord with the little brain, nor to the famous sculptor Myrtilus,
      whose body is really too delicate to bear all the laurels with which he is
      overloaded, but to you, and you alone&mdash;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon tried to contradict her, but Althea, without allowing him to speak,
      went on hurriedly: &ldquo;No matter! I wished to know whether you loved her.
      True, according to appearances, your heart does not glow for her, and
      hitherto you have disdained to transform by her aid, at a single stroke,
      the poverty which ill suits you into wealth. But it was not merely to
      speak of the daughter of Archias that I accompanied you into this tempest,
      from which I would fain escape as quickly as possible. So speak quickly. I
      am to serve you in your art, and yet, if I understood you correctly, you
      have already found here another excellent model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A native of the country,&rdquo; answered Hermon in an embarrassed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for my sake you allowed her to wait for you in vain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you had promised to seek her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; but before the appointed hour came I met you. You rose before
      me like a new sun, shedding a new light that was full of promise.
      Everything else sank into darkness, and, if you will fulfil the hope which
      you awakened in this heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment another flash of lightning blazed, and, while the
      thunder still shook the air, Althea continued his interrupted
      protestation: &ldquo;Then you will give yourself to me, body and soul&mdash;but
      Zeus, who hears oaths, is reminding us of his presence&mdash;and what will
      await you if the Biamite whom you betrayed invokes the wrath of Nemesis
      against you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Nemesis of the barbarians!&rdquo; he retorted contemptuously. &ldquo;She only
      placed herself at the service of my art reluctantly; but you, Althea, if
      you will loan yourself to me as a model, I shall succeed in doing my very
      best; for you have just permitted me to behold a miracle, Arachne herself,
      whom you became, you enchantress. It was real, actual life, and that&mdash;that
      is the highest goal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The highest?&rdquo; she asked hesitatingly. &ldquo;You will have to represent the
      female form, and beauty, Hermon, beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will be there, allied with truth,&rdquo; flamed Hermon, &ldquo;if you, you peerless,
      more than beautiful creature, keep your word to me. But you will! Let me
      be sure of it. Is a little love also blended with the wish to serve the
      artist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little love?&rdquo; she repeated scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This matter concerns love complete and full&mdash;or none. We will see
      each other again to-morrow. Then show me what the model Althea is worth to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she vanished in the darkness, while the call of her name
      again rang from the tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Althea!&rdquo; he cried in a tone of mournful reproach as he perceived her
      disappearance, hurrying after her; but the dense gloom soon forced him to
      give up the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha, too, left her place beneath the sycamore.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen and heard enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duty now commanded her to execute vengeance, and the bold Hanno was ready
      to risk his life for her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following day the sun shone radiantly, with scorching brilliancy, upon
      Tennis and the archipelago, which at this season of the year surrounded
      the little city of weavers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Philotas, without going to rest, had set out at dawn in pursuit of
      game, accompanied by a numerous hunting party, to which several of the
      Pelusinian officers belonged. He, too, had brought home a great quantity
      of booty, with which he had expected to awaken Daphne&rsquo;s admiration, and to
      lay as a token of homage at her feet. He had intended to lead before her
      garlanded slaves bearing, tied by ropes, bunches of slaughtered wild fowl,
      but his reception was very different from what he had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of praising his exploit, he had been indignantly requested to
      remove the poor, easily killed victims from her presence; and, wounded and
      disappointed, he had retired to his magnificent Nile boat, where, spent by
      his sleepless night, he slumbered so soundly on his soft cushions that he
      did not appear at the breakfast which the gray-haired commander of
      Pelusium had invited him to attend on his galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the others were still feasting there, Daphne was enjoying an hour
      alone with her companion Chrysilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had remained absent from Philippus&rsquo;s banquet, and her pale cheeks
      showed the ill effects produced by the excitement of the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before noon Hermon came to see her. He, too, had not gone to the
      Pelusinian&rsquo;s breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Althea had left him the evening before he went directly back to the
      white house, and, instead of going to rest, devoted himself to Myrtilus;
      for the difficulty of breathing, which during his industrious life in
      quiet seclusion had not troubled him for several months, attacked him with
      twofold violence after the gaiety of the previous night. Hermon had not
      left him an instant until day brought the sufferer relief, and he no
      longer needed the supporting hand of his kind nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Hermon, in his own sleeping room, ordered Bias to anoint his hair
      and beard and put on festal garments, the slave told him certain things
      that destroyed the last remnant of composure in his easily agitated soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the firm resolution to keep the appointment on Pelican Island, Hermon
      had gone at sunset, in response to the Alexandrian&rsquo;s invitation, to attend
      her banquet, and by no means unwillingly, for his parents&rsquo; old friends
      were dear to him, and he knew by experience the beneficial influence
      Daphne&rsquo;s sunny, warmhearted nature exerted upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this time he did not find what he expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, he had been obliged to witness how earnestly Philotas
      was pressing his suit, and perceived that her companion Chrysilla was most
      eagerly assisting him. As she saw in the young aristocrat a suitable
      husband for the daughter of Archias, and it was her duty to assign the
      guests their seats at the banquet, she had given the cushion beside Daphne
      to Philotas, and also willingly fulfilled Althea&rsquo;s desire to have Hermon
      for her neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Chrysilla presented the black-bearded artist to the Thracian, she
      would have sworn that Althea found an old acquaintance in the sculptor;
      but Hermon treated the far-famed relative of Queen Arsinoe as coldly and
      distantly as if he now saw her for the first time, and with little
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, he was glad to avoid women of Althea&rsquo;s stamp. For some time he
      had preferred to associate with the common people, among whom he found his
      best subjects, and kept far aloof from the court circles to which Althea
      belonged, and which, thanks to his birth and his ability as an artist,
      would easily have been accessible to him also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The over-refined women who gave themselves airs of avoiding everything
      which imposes a restraint upon Nature, and therefore, in their transparent
      robes, treated with contempt all that modest Macedonian dames deemed
      worthy of a genuine woman&rsquo;s consideration, were repulsive to him&mdash;perhaps
      because they formed so rude a contrast to his noble dead mother and to
      Daphne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he had been very frequently in feminine society, Althea&rsquo;s manner
      at first caused him a certain degree of embarrassment; for, in spite of
      the fact that he believed he met her here for the first time, there was
      something familiar about her, especially in the tone of her voice, and he
      fancied that her first words were associated with some former ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet no! If he had ever met her, he would surely have remembered her
      red-gold hair and the other peculiarities of a personality which was
      remarkable in every respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon proved that they were total strangers, and he wished matters to
      remain so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad that she attracted him so little, for at least she would
      scarcely make the early departure to the Biamite, which he considered his
      duty, a difficult task.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, he admired from the first the rare milk-white line of her delicate
      skin, which was wholly free from rouge&mdash;his artist eye perceived that
      and the wonderfully beautiful shape of her hands and feet. The pose of the
      head on the neck, too, as she turned toward him seemed remarkably fine.
      This slender, pliant woman would have been an admirable model!
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again she reminded him of a gay Lesbian with whom he had
      caroused for a night during the last Dionysia in Alexandria, yet, on
      closer inspection, the two were as different as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The former had been as free and reckless in her conduct as Althea was
      reserved. The hair and eyebrows of the Lesbian, instead of reddish gold,
      were the deepest black, and her complexion&mdash;he remembered it
      perfectly&mdash;was much darker. The resemblance probably consisted merely
      in the shape of the somewhat too narrow face, with its absolutely straight
      nose, and a chin which was rather too small, as well as in the sound of
      the high voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a serious word had reached his ears from the wanton lips of the
      Lesbian, while Althea at once desired information concerning his art, and
      showed that she was thoroughly familiar with the works and the aspirations
      of the Alexandrian sculptors. Although aware that Hermon had begun his
      career as an artist, and was the leader of a new tendency, she pretended
      to belong to the old school, and thereby irritated him to contradiction
      and the explanation of his efforts, which were rooted in the demands of
      the present day and the life of the flourishing capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thracian listened to the description of the new art struggling to
      present truth, as if these things were welcome surprises, grand
      revelations, for which she had waited with eager longing. True, she
      opposed every statement hostile to the old beliefs; but her extremely
      expressive features soon betrayed to him that he was stirring her to
      reflect, shaking her opinions, and winning her to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already, for the sake of the good cause, he devoted himself with the
      utmost zeal to the task of convincing Althea; she, however, did not make
      it an easy one, but presented clever arguments against his assertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever he or she, by way of example, mentioned any well-known work of
      art, she imitated, as if involuntarily, its pose and action with
      surprising fidelity, frequently also in admirable caricature, whose effect
      was extremely comical. What a woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was familiar with whatever Grecian art had created, and the animated
      conversation became a bewitching spectacle. When the grammateus Proclus,
      who as Althea&rsquo;s travelling companion had a certain claim upon her
      attention, mingled for a while in the discussion and attracted Althea&rsquo;s
      notice, Hermon felt injured, and answered his sensible remarks with such
      rudeness that the elder man, whose social position was so much higher,
      angrily turned his back upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Althea had imposed a certain degree of restraint upon herself while
      talking to the grammateus, but during the further conversation with Hermon
      she confessed that she was decidedly of his opinion, and added to the old
      reasons for the deposition of beauty and ideality in favour of truth and
      reality new ones which surprised the sculptor. When she at last offered
      him her hand for a firm alliance, his brain was fevered, and it seemed a
      great honour when she asked eagerly what would occupy him in the immediate
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passionate sympathy echoed in every word, was expressed in every feature,
      and she listened as if a great happiness was in store for herself when he
      disclosed the hopes which he based upon the statue of Arachne.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, as time passed he had spoken more than once of the necessity of
      retiring, and before midnight really tried to depart; but he had fallen
      under Althea&rsquo;s thrall, and, in reply to her inquiry what must shorten
      these exquisite hours, had informed her, in significant words, what drew
      him away, and that his delay threatened him with the loss of a model such
      as the favour of fate rarely bestowed upon an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Thracian for the first time permitted her eyes to make frank
      confessions. She also bent forward with a natural movement to examine the
      artistic work on a silver vase, and as while doing so her peplos fell over
      his hand, she pressed it tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed ardently up at her; but she whispered softly: &ldquo;Stay! You will
      gain through me something better than awaits you there, and not only for
      to-day and to-morrow. We shall meet again in Alexandria, and to serve your
      art there shall be a beloved duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His power of resistance was broken; yet he beckoned to his slave Bias, who
      was busied with the mixing jars, and ordered him to seek Ledscha and tell
      her not to wait longer; urgent duties detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was giving this direction, Althea had become engaged in the gay
      conversation of the others, and, as Thyone called Hermon, and he was also
      obliged to speak to Daphne, he could not again obtain an opportunity for
      private talk with the wonderful woman who held out far grander prospects
      for his art than the refractory, rude Biamite maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Althea&rsquo;s performance seemed to prove how fortunate a choice he had
      made. Her Arachne appeared like a revelation to him. If she kept her
      promise, and he succeeded in modelling her in the pose assumed while
      imagining the process of transformation, and presented her idea to the
      spectators, the great success which hitherto&mdash;because he had not
      yielded to demands which were opposed to his convictions&mdash;he had
      vainly expected, could no longer escape him. The Alexandrian
      fellow-artists who belonged to his party would gratefully welcome this
      special work; for what grew out of it would have nothing in common with
      the fascination of superhuman beauty, by which the older artists ensnared
      the hearts and minds of the multitude. He would create a genuine woman,
      who would not lack defects, yet who, though she inspired neither
      gratification nor rapture, would touch, perhaps even thrill, the heart by
      absolute truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Althea was standing on the pedestal, she had not only represented
      the transformation into the spider, but experienced it, and the features
      of the spectators revealed that they believed they were witnessing the
      sinister event. His aim was now to awaken the same feeling in the
      beholders of his Arachne. Nothing, nothing at all must be changed in the
      figure of the model, in which many might miss the roundness and plumpness
      so pleasing to the eye. Althea&rsquo;s very defects would perfect the figure of
      the restless, wretched weaver whom Athene transformed into the spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      While devoting himself to nursing his friend, he had thought far less of
      the new love-happiness which, in spite of her swift flight, was probably
      awaiting him through Althea than of the work which was to fill his
      existence in the immediate future.
    </p>
    <p>
      His healthy body, steeled in the palaestra, felt no fatigue after the
      sleepless night passed amid so many powerful excitements when he retired
      to his chamber and committed himself to the hands of his slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had not been possible to hear his report before, but when he at last
      received it Hermon was to learn something extremely unpleasant, and not
      only because no word of apology or even explanation of his absence had
      reached Ledscha.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias was little to blame for this neglect, for, in the first place, he had
      found no boat to reach the Pelican Island, because half Tennis was on the
      road to Tanis, where, on the night of the full moon, the brilliant
      festivals of the full eye of Horns and the great Astarte were celebrated
      by the mixed population of this place. When a boat which belonged to
      Daphne&rsquo;s galley was finally given to him, the Biamite girl was no longer
      at the place appointed for the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoping to find her on the Owl&rsquo;s Nest with old Tabus, he then landed there,
      but had been so uncivilly rebuffed on the shore by a rough fellow that he
      might be glad to have escaped with sound limbs. Lastly, he stole to
      Ledscha&rsquo;s home, and, knowing that her father was absent, had ventured as
      far as the open courtyard in the centre of the stately dwelling. The dogs
      knew him, and as a light was shining from one of the rooms that opened
      upon the courtyard, he peeped in and saw Taus, Ledscha&rsquo;s younger sister.
      She was kneeling before the statue of a god at the back of the room,
      weeping, while the old housekeeper had fallen asleep with the distaff in
      her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called cautiously to the pretty child. She was awaiting the return of
      her sister, who, she supposed, was still detained on the Owl&rsquo;s Nest by old
      Tabus&rsquo;s predictions; she had sorrowful tidings for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband of her friend Gula had returned on his ship and learned that
      his wife had gone to the Greek&rsquo;s studio. He had raged like a madman, and
      turned the unfortunate woman pitilessly out of doors after sunset. Her own
      parents had only been induced to receive her with great difficulty.
      Paseth, the jealous husband, had spared her life and refrained from going
      at once to kill the artist solely because Hermon had saved his little
      daughter at his own peril from the burning house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Ledscha&rsquo;s pretty little sister, &ldquo;it would also be known that
      she had gone with Gula to his master, who was certainly a handsome man,
      but for whom, now that young Smethis was wooing her, she cared no more
      than she did for her runaway cat. All Tennis would point at her, and she
      dared not even think what her father would do when he came home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These communications had increased Hermon&rsquo;s anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a brave man, and did not fear the vengeance of the enraged husband,
      against whom he was conscious of no guilt except having persuaded his wife
      to commit an imprudence. What troubled him was only the consciousness that
      he had given her and innocent little Taus every reason to curse their
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ardent warmth with which Gula blessed him as the preserver of her
      child had given him infinite pleasure. Now it seemed as if he had been
      guilty of an act of baseness by inducing her to render a service which was
      by no means free from danger, as though he wished to be paid for a good
      deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the slave had represented the possible consequences of his
      imprudence in the most gloomy light, and, with the assurance of knowing
      the disposition of his fellow-countrymen, urged his master to leave Tennis
      at once; the other Biamite men, who would bear anything rather than the
      interference of a Greek in their married lives, might force Gula&rsquo;s husband
      to take vengeance on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing about anxiety concerning his own safety, but he had good
      reason to fear being regarded as a go-between and called to account for
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his warnings and entreaties seemed to find deaf ears in Hermon. True,
      he intended to leave Tennis as soon as possible, for what advantage could
      he now find here? First, however, he must attend to the packing of the
      statues, and then try to appease Ledscha, and make Gula&rsquo;s husband
      understand that he was casting off his pretty wife unjustly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not think of making a hasty departure, he told the slave,
      especially as he was to meet Althea, Queen Arsinoe&rsquo;s art-appreciating
      relative, in whom he had gained a friend, later in Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bias informed him of a discovery to which one of the Thracian&rsquo;s slave
      women had helped him, and what he carelessly told his master drove the
      blood from his cheeks, and, though his voice was almost stifled by
      surprise and shame, made him assail him with questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      What great thing had he revealed? There had been reckless gaiety at every
      festival of Dionysus since he had been in the artist&rsquo;s service, and the
      slaves had indulged in the festal mirth no less freely than the masters.
      To intoxicate themselves with wine, the gift of the god to whom they were
      paying homage, was not only permitted, but commanded, and the juice of the
      grape proved its all-equalizing power.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no lack of pretty companions even for him, the bondman, and
      the most beautiful of all had made eyes at his master, the tall, slender
      man with the splendid black beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reckless Lesbian who had favoured Hermon at the last Dionysia had
      played pranks with him madly enough, but then had suddenly vanished. By
      his master&rsquo;s orders Bias had tried to find her again, but, in spite of
      honest search, in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now he had met, as Althea&rsquo;s maid, the little Syrian Margula, who had
      been in her company, and raced along in the procession of bacchanals in
      his, Bias&rsquo;s, arms. True, she could not be persuaded to make a frank
      confession, but he, Bias, would let his right hand wither if Hermon&rsquo;s
      companion at the Dionysia was any other than Althea. His master would own
      that he was right if he imagined her with black hair instead of red.
      Plenty of people in Alexandria practised the art of dyeing, and it was
      well known that Queen Arsinoe herself willingly mingled in the throng at
      the Dionysia with a handsome Ephebi, who did not suspect the identity of
      his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the information which had so deeply agitated Hermon, and then led
      him, after pacing to and fro a short time, to go first to Myrtilus and
      then to Daphne.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found his friend sleeping, and though every fibre of his being
      urged him to speak to him, he forced himself to leave the sufferer
      undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet so torturing a sense of dissatisfaction with himself, so keen a
      resentment against his own adverse destiny had awaked within him, that he
      could no longer endure to remain in the presence of his work, with which
      he was more and more dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away from the studio!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gay party on board the galley of his parents&rsquo; old friends.
      Wine should bring him forgetfulness, too, bless him again with the sense
      of joyous existence which he knew so well, and which he now seemed on the
      point of losing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had once talked and drunk himself into the right mood, life would
      wear a less gloomy face.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! It should once more be a gay and reckless one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Althea?
    </p>
    <p>
      He would meet her, with whom he had once caroused and revelled madly
      enough in the intoxication of the last Dionysia, and, instead of allowing
      himself to be fooled any longer and continuing to bow respectfully before
      her, would assert all the rights she had formerly so liberally granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would enjoy to-day, forget to-morrow, and be gay with the gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eager for new pleasure, he drew a long breath as he went out into the open
      air, pressed his hands upon his broad chest, and with his eyes fixed upon
      the commandant of Pelusium&rsquo;s galley, bedecked with flags, walked swiftly
      toward the landing place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly from the deck, shaded by an awning, the loud laugh of a woman&rsquo;s
      shrill voice reached his ear, blended with the deeper tones of the
      grammateus, whose attacks on the previous night Hermon had not forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped as if the laugh had pierced him to the heart. Proclus appeared
      to be on the most familiar terms with Althea, and to meet him with the
      Thracian now seemed impossible. He longed for mirth and pleasure, but was
      unwilling to share it with these two. As he dared not disturb Myrtilus,
      there was only one place where he could find what he needed, and this was&mdash;he
      had said so to himself when he turned his back on his sleeping friend&mdash;in
      Daphne&rsquo;s society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only yesterday he would have sought her without a second thought, but
      to-day Althea&rsquo;s declaration that he was the only man whom the daughter of
      Archias loved stood between him and his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that from childhood she had watched his every step with sisterly
      affection. A hundred times she had proved her loyalty; yet, dear as she
      was to him, willingly as he would have risked his life to save her from a
      danger, it had never entered his mind to give the tie that united them the
      name of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      An older relative of both in Alexandria had once advised him, when he was
      complaining of his poverty, to seek her hand, but his pride of manhood
      rebelled against having the wealth which fate denied flung into his lap by
      a woman. When she looked at him with her honest eyes, he could never have
      brought himself to feign anything, least of all a passion of which,
      tenderly attached to her though he had been for years, hitherto he had
      known nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love her?&rdquo; Hermon asked himself as he walked toward Daphne&rsquo;s tent,
      and the anticipated &ldquo;No&rdquo; had pressed itself upon him far less quickly than
      he expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing was undeniably certain: whoever won her for a wife&mdash;even
      though she were the poorest of the poor&mdash;must be numbered among the
      most enviable of men. And should he not recognise in his aversion to every
      one of her suitors, and now to the aristocratic young Philotas, a feeling
      which resembled jealousy?
    </p>
    <p>
      No! He did not and would not love Daphne. If she were really his, and
      whatever concerned him had become hers, with whom could he have sought in
      hours like these soothing, kind, and sensible counsel, comfort that calmed
      the heart, and the refreshing dew which his fading courage and faltering
      creative power required?
    </p>
    <p>
      The bare thought of touching clay and wax with his fingers, or taking
      hammer, chisel, and file in his hands, was now repulsive; and when, just
      outside of the tent, a Biamite woman who was bringing fish to the cook
      reminded him of Ledscha, and that he had lost in her the right model for
      his Arachne, he scarcely regretted it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Outside the door of the tent Hermon was trying to banish Althea&rsquo;s image
      from his mind. How foolishly he had overestimated last night the value of
      this miserable actress, who as a woman had lost all charm for him&mdash;even
      as a model for his Arachne!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would rather have appeared before his pure friend with unsightly stains
      on his robe than while mastered by yearning for the Thracian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first glance at Daphne&rsquo;s beloved face, the first words of her
      greeting, taught him that he should find with her everything for which he
      longed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In simple, truthful words she reproached him for having neglected her to
      the verge of incivility the evening before, but there was no trace of
      bitterness or resentment in the accusation, and she gave Hermon little
      time for apology, but quickly gladdened him with words of forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the opinion of her companion Chrysilla, Daphne ought to have kept the
      capricious artist waiting much longer for pardon. True, the cautious woman
      took no part in the conversation afterward, but she kept her charge in
      sight while she was skilfully knotting the fringe into a cloth which she
      had woven herself. On account of her favourite Philotas, it was well for
      Daphne to be aware that she was watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chrysilla was acquainted with life, and knew that Eros never mingles more
      arbitrarily in the intercourse of a young couple than when, after a long
      separation, there is anything whatever to forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, many words which the two exchanged escaped her hearing, for they
      talked in low tones, and it was hot in the tent. Often the fatigue she
      felt after the sleepless night bowed her head, still comely with its
      unwrinkled face, though she was no longer young; then she quickly raised
      it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Daphne nor Hermon noticed her. The former at once perceived that
      something was weighing on the sculptor&rsquo;s mind, but he did not need any
      long inquiry. He had come to confide his troubles to her, and she kindly
      lightened the task for him by asking why he had not gone to breakfast with
      the Pelusinians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am not fit for gay company today,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again dissatisfied with Fate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, it has given me small cause for contentment of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put in place of Fate the far-seeing care of the gods, and you will accept
      what befalls you less unkindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us stick to us mortals, I entreat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. Your Demeter does not fully satisfy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A discontented shrug of the shoulders was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then work with twofold zeal upon the Arachne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although one model I hoped to obtain forsook me, and my soul is estranged
      from the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Althea?&rdquo; she asked eagerly, and he nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne clapped her hands joyfully, exclaiming so loudly that Chrysilla&rsquo;s
      head sprang up with a jerk. &ldquo;It could not help being so! O Hermon! how
      anxious I have been! Now, I thought, when this horrible woman represented
      the transformation into the spider with such repulsive accuracy, Hermon
      will believe that this is the true, and therefore the right, ideal; nay, I
      was deceived myself while gazing. But, eternal gods! as soon as I imagined
      this Arachne in marble or chryselephantine work, what a painful feeling
      overpowered me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he replied in an irritated tone. &ldquo;The thirst for beauty, to
      which you all succumb, would not have much satisfaction to expect from
      this work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; Daphne interrupted in a louder tone than usual, and with the
      earnest desire to convince him. &ldquo;Precisely because I transported myself
      into your tendency, your aspirations, I recognised the danger. O Hermon!
      what produced so sinister an effect by the wavering light of the lamps and
      torches, while the thunderstorm was rising&mdash;the strands of hair, the
      outspread fingers, the bewildered, staring blue eyes&mdash;do you not feel
      yourself how artificial, how unnatural it all was? This transformation was
      only a clever trick of acting, nothing more. Before a quiet spectator, in
      the pure, truthful light of Apollo, the foe of all deception, what would
      this Arachne probably become? Even now&mdash;I have already said so&mdash;when
      I imagine her executed in marble or in gold and ivory! Beauty? Who would
      expect to find in the active, constantly toiling weaver, the mortal
      daughter of an industrious dyer in purple, the calm, refreshing charm of
      divine women? I at least am neither foolish nor unjust enough to do so.
      The degree of beauty Althea possesses would entirely satisfy me for the
      Arachne. But when I imagine a plastic work faithful to the model of
      yesterday evening&mdash;though I have seen a great deal with my own eyes,
      and am always ready to defer to riper judgment&mdash;I would think, while
      looking at it: This statue came to the artist from the stage, but never
      from Nature. Such would be my view, and I am not one of the initiated. But
      the adepts! The King, with his thorough connoisseurship and fine taste, my
      father, and the other famous judges, how much more keenly they would
      perceive and define it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she hesitated, for the blood had left Hermon&rsquo;s cheeks, and she saw
      with surprise the deep impression which the candid expression of her
      opinion had produced upon the artist, usually so independent and disposed
      to contradiction. Her judgment had undoubtedly disturbed, nay, perhaps
      convinced him; but at the same time his features revealed such deep
      depression that, far from rejoicing in so rare a success, she patted his
      arm like an affectionate sister, saying: &ldquo;You have not yet found time to
      realize calmly what yesterday dazzled us all&mdash;and you,&rdquo; she added in
      a lower tone, &ldquo;the most strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he murmured sadly, half to himself, half to, her, &ldquo;my vision is
      doubly clear. Close before the success of which I dreamed failure and
      bitter disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this &lsquo;doubly&rsquo; refers to your completed work, and also to the Arachne,&rdquo;
       cried Daphne in the affectionate desire to soothe him, &ldquo;a pleasant
      surprise will perhaps soon await you, for Myrtilus judges your Demeter
      much more favourably than you yourself do, and he also betrayed to me whom
      it resembles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed slightly as she spoke, and, as her companion&rsquo;s gloomy face
      brightened for a short time, went on eagerly: &ldquo;And now for the Arachne.
      You will and must succeed in what you so ardently strive to accomplish, a
      subject so exactly adapted to your magnificent virile genius and so
      strangely suited to the course which your art has once entered upon. And
      you can not fail to secure the right model. You had not found it in
      Althea, no, certainly not! O Hermon! if I could only make you see clearly
      how ill suited she, in whom everything is false, is to you&mdash;your art,
      your only too powerful strength, your aspiration after truth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hate her,&rdquo; he broke in here in a repellent tone; but Daphne dropped
      her quiet composure, and her gray eyes, usually so gentle, flashed
      fiercely as she exclaimed: &ldquo;Yes, and again yes! From my inmost soul I do,
      and I rejoice in it. I have long disliked her, but since yesterday I abhor
      her like the spider which she can simulate, like snakes and toads,
      falsehood and vice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon had never seen his uncle&rsquo;s peaceful daughter in this mood. The
      emotions that rendered this kindly soul so unlike itself could only be the
      one powerful couple, love and jealousy; and while gazing intently at her
      face, which in this moment seemed to him as beautiful as Dallas Athene
      armed for battle, he listened breathlessly as she continued: &ldquo;Already the
      murderous spider had half entangled you in her net. She drew you out into
      the tempest&mdash;our steward Gras saw it&mdash;in order, while Zeus was
      raging, to deliver you to the wrath of the other gods also and the
      contempt of all good men; for whoever yields himself to her she destroys,
      sucks the marrow from his bones like the greedy harpies, and all that is
      noble from his soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Daphne,&rdquo; interrupted Chrysilla, raising herself from her cushions in
      alarm, &ldquo;must I remind you of the moderation which distinguishes the Greeks
      from the barbarians, and especially the Hellenic woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Daphne indignantly broke in: &ldquo;Whoever practises moderation in the
      conflict against vice has already gone halfway over to evil. She utterly
      ruined&mdash;how long ago is it?&mdash;the unfortunate Menander, my poor
      Ismene&rsquo;s young husband. You know them both, Hermon. Here, of course, you
      scarcely heard how she lured him from his wife and the lovely little girl
      who bears my name. She tempted the poor fellow to her ship, only to cast
      him off at the end of a month for another. Now he is at home again, but he
      thinks Ismene is the statue from the Temple of Isis, which has gained life
      and speech; for he has lost his mind, and when I saw him I felt as if I
      should die of horror and pity. Now she is coming home with Proclus, and,
      as the way led through Pelusium, she attached herself to our friends and
      forces herself in here with them. What does she care about her elderly
      travelling companion? But you&mdash;yes, you, Hermon&mdash;are the next
      person whom she means to capture. Just now, when my eyes closed But no! It
      is not only in my dreams; the hideous gray threads which proceed from this
      greedy spider are continually floating before me and dim the light.&rdquo; Here
      she paused, for the maid Stephanion announced the coming of visitors, and
      at the same time loud voices were heard outside, and the merry party who
      had been attending the breakfast given by the commandant of Pelusium
      entered the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Althea was among the guests, but she took little notice of Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proclus, her associate in Queen Arsinoe&rsquo;s favour, was again asserting his
      rights as her travelling companion, and she showed him plainly that the
      attention which he paid her was acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile her eager, bright blue eyes were roving everywhere, and nothing
      that was passing around her escaped her notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she greeted Daphne she perceived that her cheeks had flushed during her
      conversation with Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      How reserved and embarrassed the sculptor&rsquo;s manner was now to his uncle&rsquo;s
      daughter, whom only yesterday he had treated with as much freedom as
      though she were his sister! What a bungler in dissimulation! how
      short-sighted was this big, strong man and remarkable artist! He had
      carried her, Althea, in his arms like a child for a whole quarter of an
      hour at the festival of Dionysus, and, in spite of the sculptor&rsquo;s keen
      eye, he did not recognise her again!
    </p>
    <p>
      What would not dyes and a change of manner accomplish!
    </p>
    <p>
      Or had the memory of those mad hours revived and caused his embarrassment?
      If he should know that her companion, the Milesian Nanno, whom he had
      feasted with her on oyster pasties at Canopus after she had given the slip
      to her handsome young companion was Queen Arsinoe! Perhaps she would
      inform him of it some day if he recognised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet that could scarcely have happened. He had only been told what she
      betrayed to him yesterday, and was now neglecting her for Daphne&rsquo;s sake.
      That was undoubtedly the way the matter stood. How the girl&rsquo;s cheeks were
      glowing when she entered!
    </p>
    <p>
      The obstacle that stood between her and Hermon was the daughter of
      Archias, and she, fool that she was, had attracted Hermon&rsquo;s attention to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would want her for the Arachne, and she needed only to stretch out her
      hand to draw him to her again if she found no better amusement in
      Alexandria. Now she would awaken his fears that the best of models would
      recall her favour. Besides, it would not do to resume the pleasant game
      with him under the eyes of Philippus and his wife, who was a follower of
      the manners of old times. The right course now was to keep him until
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing at Proclus&rsquo;s side, she took part gaily in the general
      conversation; but when Myrtilus and Philemon had joined the others, and
      Daphne had consented to go with Philippus and Thyone that evening, in
      order, after offering sacrifice together to Selene, to sail for Pelusium,
      Althea requested the grammateus to take her, into the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving the tent, however, she dropped her ostrich-feather fan as
      she passed Hermon, and, when he picked it up, whispered with a significant
      glance at Daphne, &ldquo;I see that what was learned of her heart is turned to
      account promptly enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, laughing gaily, she continued loudly enough to be heard by her
      companion also: &ldquo;Yesterday our young artist maintained that the Muse
      shunned abundance; but the works of his wealthy friend Myrtilus
      contradicted him, and he changed his view with the speed of lightning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that this swift alteration had concerned the direction of his art,&rdquo;
       replied Proclus in a tone audible to her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both left the tent as he spoke, and Hermon uttered a sigh of relief as he
      looked after them. She attributed the basest motives to him, and Daphne&rsquo;s
      opinion of her was scarcely too severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He no longer needed to fear her power of attraction, though, now that he
      had seen her again, he better understood the spell which she had exerted
      over him. Every movement of her lithe figure had an exquisite grace, whose
      charm was soothing to the artist&rsquo;s eye. Only there was something piercing
      in her gaze when it did not woo love, and, while making the base charge,
      her extremely thin lips had showed her sharp teeth in a manner that
      reminded him of the way the she-wolf among the King&rsquo;s wild beasts in the
      Paneum gardens raised her lips when any one went near her cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne was right. Ledscha would have been infinitely better as a model for
      the Arachne. Everything in this proud creature was genuine and original,
      which was certainly not the case with Althea. Besides, stern austerity was
      as much a part of the Biamite as her hair and her hands, yet what ardent
      passion he had seen glow in her eyes! The model so long sought in vain he
      had found in Ledscha, who in so many respects resembled Arachne. Fool that
      he was to have yielded to a swift and false ebullition of feeling!
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Myrtilus was again near him Hermon had devoted himself with fresh
      eagerness to his artistic task, while a voice within cried more and more
      loudly that the success of his new work depended entirely upon Ledscha. He
      must try to regain her as a model for the Arachne! But while pondering
      over the &ldquo;how,&rdquo; he felt a rare sense of pleasure when Daphne spoke to him
      or her glance met his.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he had devoted himself eagerly to his father&rsquo;s old friends, and
      especially to Thyone, and had not found it quite easy to remain firm when,
      in her frank, kindly, cordial manner, she tried to persuade him to
      accompany her and the others to Pelusium. Yet he had succeeded in refusing
      the worthy couple&rsquo;s invitation. But when he saw Philotas, whose
      resemblance to the King, his cousin, had just been mentioned by one of the
      officers, become more and more eager in his attentions to Daphne, and
      heard him also invited by Philippus to share the nocturnal voyage, he felt
      disturbed, and could not conceal from himself that the uneasiness which
      constantly obtained a greater mastery over him arose from the fear of
      losing his friend to the young aristocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was jealousy, and where it flamed so hotly love could scarcely be
      absent. Yet, had the shaft of Eros really struck him, how was it possible
      that the longing to win Ledscha back stirred so strongly within him that
      he finally reached a resolution concerning her?
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the guests left Tennis he would approach the Biamite again. He
      had already whispered this intention to Myrtilus, when he heard Daphne&rsquo;s
      companion say to Thyone, &ldquo;Philotas will accompany us, and on this voyage
      they will plight their troth if Aphrodite&rsquo;s powerful son accepts my
      sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He involuntarily looked at the pair who were intended for each other, and
      saw Daphne lower her eyes, blushing, at a whisper from the young
      Macedonian.
    </p>
    <p>
      His blood also crimsoned his cheeks, and when, soon after, he asked his
      friend whether she cared for his companionship, and Daphne assented in the
      most eager way, he said that he would share the voyage to Pelusium.
      Daphne&rsquo;s eyes had never yet beamed upon him so gladly and graciously.
      Althea was right. She must love him, and it seemed as if this conviction
      awoke a new star of happiness in his troubled soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Philotas imagined that he could pluck the daughter of Archias like a
      ripe fruit from a tree, he would find himself mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon did not yet exactly understand himself, only he felt certain that
      it would be impossible to surrender Daphne to another, and that for her
      sake he would give up twenty Ledschas, though he cherished infinitely
      great expectations from the Biamite for his art, which hitherto had been
      more to him than all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything that he still had to do in Tennis he could intrust to his
      conscientious Bias, to Myrtilus, and his slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he returned to the city of weavers, he would earnestly endeavour to
      palliate the offence which he had inflicted on Ledscha, and, if possible,
      obtain her forgiveness. Only one thing detained him&mdash;anxiety about
      his friend, who positively refused to share the night voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had promised his uncle Archias to care for him like a brother, and his
      own kind heart bade him stay with Myrtilus, and not leave him to the
      nursing of his very skilful but utterly unreliable body-servant, after the
      last night had proved to what severe attacks of his disease he was still
      liable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myrtilus, however, earnestly entreated him not to deprive himself on his
      account of a pleasure which he would gladly have shared. There was plenty
      of time to pack the statues. As for himself, nothing would do him more
      good just now than complete rest in his beloved solitude, which, as Hermon
      knew, was more welcome to him than the gayest society. Nothing was to be
      feared for him now. The thunderstorm had purified the air, and another one
      was not to be expected soon in this dry region. He had always been well
      here in sunny weather. Storms, which were especially harmful to him, never
      came at this season of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myrtilus secretly thought that Hermon&rsquo;s departure would be desirable,
      because the slave Bias had confided to him what dangers threatened his
      friend from the incensed Biamite husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Myrtilus turned to the others and begged them not to let Hermon
      leave Pelusium quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at parting, he was alone with him, he embraced him and said more
      tenderly than usual: &ldquo;You know how easy it will be for me to depart from
      life; but it would be easier still if I could leave you behind without
      anxiety, and that would happen if the hymeneal hymns at your marriage to
      Daphne preceded the dirges which will soon resound above my coffin.
      Yesterday I first became sure that she loves you, and, much good as you
      have in your nature, you owe the best to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon clasped him in his arms with passionate affection, and after
      confessing that he, too, felt drawn with the utmost power toward Daphne,
      and urging him to anticipate complete recovery instead of an early death,
      he held out his hand to his friend; but Myrtilus clasped it a long time in
      his own, saying earnestly: &ldquo;Only this one frank warning: An Arachne like
      the model which Althea presented yesterday evening would deal the past of
      your art a blow in the face. No one at Rhodes&mdash;and this is just what
      I prize in you&mdash;hated imitation more, yet what would using the
      Arachne on the pedestal for a model be except showing the world not how
      Hermon, but how Althea imagines the hapless transformed mortal? Even if
      Ledscha withdraws from you, hold fast to her image. It will live on in
      your soul. Recall it there, free it from whatever is superfluous, supply
      whatever it lacks, animate it with the idea of the tireless artist, the
      mocking, defiant mortal woman who ended her life as the weaver of weavers
      in the insect world, as you have so often vividly described her to me.
      Then, my dear fellow, you will remain loyal to yourself, and therefore
      also to the higher truth, toward which every one of us who labours
      earnestly strives, and, myself included, there is no one who wields hammer
      and chisel in Greece who could contest the prize with you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      When the sun was approaching the western horizon the travellers started.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Light mists veiled the radiant right eye of the goddess of heaven. The
      blood of the contending spirits of light and darkness, which usually dyed
      the west of Egypt crimson at the departure of the great sun god, to-day
      vanished from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sultry air was damp and oppressive, and experienced old Philippus, who
      had commanded a fleet of considerable size under the first Ptolemies,
      agreed with the captain of the vessel, who pointed to several small dark
      clouds under the silvery stratus, and expressed the fear that Selene would
      hardly illumine the ship&rsquo;s course during the coming night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the departure the travellers had offered sacrifices to the
      foam-born Cyprian Aphrodite and the Dioscuri, the protectors of mariners,
      and the conversation took the gayest turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the harbour of the neighbouring seaport Tanis they went aboard of the
      commandant&rsquo;s state galley, one of the largest and finest in the royal
      fleet, where a banquet awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cushions were arranged on the high poop, and the sea was as smooth as the
      silver dishes in which viands were offered to the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, not a breath stirred the still, sultry air, but the three long
      double ranks of rowers in the hold of the ship provided for her swift
      progress, and if no contrary wind sprang up she would run into the harbour
      of Pelusium before the last goblet was emptied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the departure it seemed as if the captain of the little vessel
      had erred in his prediction, for the moon burst victoriously through the
      black clouds, only its shining orb was surrounded by a dull, glimmering
      halo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless many a guest longed for a cool breeze, but when the mixed wine
      had moistened the parched tongues the talk gained fresh animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one did his or her part, for the point in question was to induce
      Philippus and his wife to visit Alexandria again and spend some time there
      as beloved guests with Daphne in her father&rsquo;s house or in the palace of
      Philotas, who jestingly, yet with many reasons, contested the honour with
      the absent Archias.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old warrior had remained away from the capital for several years; he
      alone knew why. Now the act which had incensed him and the offence
      inflicted upon him were forgotten, and, having passed seventy four years,
      he intended to ask the commander in chief once more for the retirement
      from the army which the monarch had several times refused, in order, as a
      free man, to seek again the city which in his present position he had so
      long avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone, it is true, thought that her husband&rsquo;s youthful vigour rendered
      this step premature, but the visit to Alexandria harmonized with her own
      wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proclus eagerly sided with her. &ldquo;To him,&rdquo; said the man of manifold
      knowledge, who as high priest of Apollo was fond of speaking in an
      instructive tone, &ldquo;experience showed that men like Philippus, who solely
      on account of the number of their years withdrew their services from the
      state, felt unhappy, and, like the unused ploughshare, became prematurely
      rusty. What they lacked, and what Philippus would also miss, was not
      merely the occupation, which might easily be supplied by another, but
      still more the habit of command. One who had had thousands subject to his
      will was readily overcome by the feeling that he was going down hill, when
      only a few dozen of his own slaves and his wife obeyed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This word aroused the mirth of old Philippus, who praised all the good
      qualities of Macedonian wives except that of obedience, while Thyone
      protested that during her more than forty years of married life her
      husband had become so much accustomed to her complete submission than he
      no longer noticed it. If Philippus should command her to-morrow to leave
      their comfortable palace in Pelusium to accompany him to Alexandria, where
      they possessed no home of their own, he would see how willingly she obeyed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, her bright, clear eyes, which seemed to float in the deep
      hollows sunk by age, sparkled so merrily in her wrinkled face that
      Philippus shook his finger gaily at her and showed plainly how much
      pleasure the jest of the old companion of his wanderings gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he insisted upon his purpose of not entering Alexandria again until he
      had resigned his office, and to do this at present was impossible, since
      he was bound just now, as if with chains, to the important frontier
      fortress. Besides, there had probably been little change in the capital
      since the death of his beloved old companion in arms and master, the late
      King.
    </p>
    <p>
      This assertion evoked a storm of contradiction, and even the younger
      officers, who usually imposed severe restraint upon themselves in the
      general&rsquo;s presence, raised their voices to prove that they, too, had
      looked around the flourishing capital with open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was not six decades since Philippus, then a lad of seventeen, had
      been present at its foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father, who had commanded as hipparch a division of cavalry in the
      army of Alexander the Great, had sent for the sturdy youth just at that
      time to come to Egypt, that he might enter the army. The conqueror of the
      world had himself assigned him, as a young Macedonian of good family, to
      the corps of the Hetairoi; and how the vigorous old man&rsquo;s eyes sparkled
      as, with youthful enthusiasm, he spoke of the divine vanquisher of the
      world who had at that time condescended to address him, gazed at him
      keenly yet encouragingly with his all-discerning but kindly blue eyes, and
      extended his hand to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;made this rough right hand precious to me. Often when,
      in Asia, in scorching India, and later here also, wounded or exhausted, it
      was ready to refuse its service, a spirit voice within cried, &lsquo;Do not
      forget that he touched it&rsquo;; and then, as if I had drunk the noble wine of
      Byblus, a fiery stream flowed from my heart into the paralyzed hand, and,
      as though animated with new life, I used it again and kept it worthy of
      his touch. To have seen a darling of the gods like him, young men, makes
      us greater. It teaches us how even we human beings are permitted to
      resemble the immortals. Now he is transported among the gods, and the
      Olympians received him, if any one, gladly. Whoever shared the deeds of
      such a hero takes a small portion of his renown with him through life and
      into the grave, and whom he touched, as befell me, feels himself
      consecrated, and whatever is petty and base flows away from him like water
      from the anointed body of the wrestler. Therefore I consider myself
      fortunate above thousands of others, and if there is anything which still
      tempts me to go to Alexandria, it is the desire to touch his dead body
      once more. To do that before I die is my most ardent desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then gratify it!&rdquo; cried Thyone with urgent impatience; but Proclus turned
      to the matron, and, after exchanging a hasty glance with Althea, said:
      &ldquo;You probably know, my venerable friend, that Queen Arsinoe, who most
      deeply honours your illustrious husband, had already arranged to have him
      summoned to the capital as priest of Alexander. True, in this position he
      would have had the burden of disposing of all the revenues from the
      temples throughout Egypt; but, on the other hand, he would always have his
      master&rsquo;s mortal remains near and be permitted to be their guardian. What
      influences baffled the Queen&rsquo;s wish certainly have not remained hidden
      from you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; replied Philippus gravely. &ldquo;Not the least whisper of
      this matter reached my ears, and it is fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Althea eagerly interrupted; &ldquo;nothing else was talked of for
      weeks in the royal palace. Queen Arsinoe&mdash;you might be jealous, Lady
      Thyone&mdash;has been fairly in love with your hero ever since her last
      stay in your house on her way home from Thrace, and she has not yet given
      up her desire to see him in the capital as priest of Alexander. It seems
      to her just and fair that the old companion of the greatest of the great
      should have the highest place, next to her husband&rsquo;s, in the city whose
      foundation he witnessed. Arsinoe speaks of you also with all the affection
      natural to her feeling heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is as flattering as it is surprising,&rdquo; replied Thyone. &ldquo;The
      attention we showed her in Pelusium was nothing more than we owed to the
      wife of the sovereign. But the court is not the principal attraction that
      draws me to the capital. It would make Philippus happy&mdash;you have just
      heard him say so&mdash;to remember his old master beside the tomb of
      Alexander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Daphne, &ldquo;how amazed you will be when you see the present form
      of the &lsquo;Soma&rsquo;, in which rests the golden coffin with the body of the
      divine hero whom the fortunate Philippus aided to conquer the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are jesting,&rdquo; interrupted the old warrior. &ldquo;I aided him only as the
      drops in the stream help to turn the wheel of the mill. As to his body,
      true, I marched at the head of the procession which bore it to Memphis and
      thence to Alexandria. In the Soma I was permitted to think of him with
      devout reverence, and meantime I felt as if I had again seen him with
      these eyes&mdash;exactly as he looked in the Egyptian fishing village of
      Rhacotis, which he transformed into your magnificent Alexandria. What a
      youth he was! Even what would have been a defect in others became a beauty
      in him. The powerful neck which supported his divine head was a little
      crooked; but what grace it lent him when he turned kindly to any one! One
      scarcely noticed it, and yet it was like the bend of a petitioner, and
      gave the wish which he expressed resistless power. When he stood erect,
      the sharpest eye could not detect it. Would that he could appear before me
      thus once more! Besides, the buildings which surrounded the golden coffin
      were nearly completed at the time of our departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the statues, reliefs, and mosaic work were lacking,&rdquo; said Hermon.
      &ldquo;They were executed by Lysippus, Euphranor, and others of our greatest
      artists; the paintings by Apelles himself, Antiphilus, and Nicias. Only
      those who had won renown were permitted to take part in this work, and the
      Ares rushing to battle, created by our Myrtilus, can be seen among the
      others. The tomb of Alexander was not entirely completed until three years
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time as the Paneum,&rdquo; added Philotas, completing the sentence;
      and Althea, waving her beaker toward the old hero, remarked: &ldquo;When you
      have your quarters in the royal palace with your crowned admirer, Arsinoe&mdash;which,
      I hope, will be very soon&mdash;I will be your guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That office is already bestowed on me by the Lady Thyone,&rdquo; Daphne quietly
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that, in this case, obedience is the husband&rsquo;s duty?&rdquo; cried
      the other, with a sneering laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would only be the confirmation of a wise choice,&rdquo; replied Philippus,
      who disliked the Thracian&rsquo;s fawning manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone, too, did not favour her, and had glanced indignantly at her when
      Althea made her rude remark. Now she turned to Daphne, and her plain face
      regained its pleasant expression as she exclaimed: &ldquo;We really promised
      your father to let him show us the way, child; but, unfortunately, we are
      not yet in Alexandria and the Paneum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would set out to-morrow,&rdquo; Hermon protested, &ldquo;if we could succeed
      in fitly describing what now awaits you there. There is only one
      Alexandria, and no city in the world can offer a more beautiful scene than
      is visible from the mountain in the Paneum gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; protested the young hipparch, who had studied in Athens.
      &ldquo;I stood on the Acropolis; I was permitted to visit Rhodes and Miletus&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you saw nothing more beautiful there,&rdquo; cried Proclus. &ldquo;The
      aristocratic Roman envoys, who left us a short time ago, admitted the same
      thing. They are just men, for the view from the Capitol of their growing
      city is also to be seen. When the King&rsquo;s command led me to the Tiber, many
      things surprised me; but, as a whole, how shall I compare the two cities?
      The older Rome, with her admirable military power: a barbarian who is just
      beginning to cultivate more refined manners&mdash;Alexandria: a rich,
      aristocratic Hellene who, like you, my young friend, completed her
      education in Ilissus, and unites to the elegant taste and intellect of the
      Athenian the mysterious thoughtfulness of the Egyptian, the tireless
      industry of the Jew, and the many-sided wisdom and brilliant magnificence
      of the other Oriental countries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who disdains to dazzle the eyes with Asiatic splendour,&rdquo; interrupted
      Philotas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet what do we not hear about the unprecedented luxury in the royal
      palace!&rdquo; growled the gray-haired warrior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parsimony&mdash;the gods be praised!&mdash;no one need expect from our
      royal pair,&rdquo; Althea broke in; &ldquo;but King Ptolemy uses his paternal wealth
      for very different purposes than glittering gems and golden chambers. If
      you disdain my guidance, honoured hero, at least accept that of some
      genuine Alexandrian. Then you will understand Proclus&rsquo;s apt simile. You
      ought to begin with the royal palaces in the Brucheium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no-with the harbour of Eunostus!&rdquo; interrupted the grammateus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the Soma!&rdquo; cried the young hipparch, while Daphne wished to have the
      tour begin in the Paneum gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were already laid out when we left Alexandria,&rdquo; said Thyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they have grown marvellously, as if creative Nature had doubled her
      powers in their behalf,&rdquo; Hermon added eagerly. &ldquo;But man has also wrought
      amazing miracles here. Industrious hands reared an actual mountain. A
      winding path leads to the top, and when you stand upon the summit and look
      northward you at first feel like the sailor who steps on shore and hears
      the people speak a language which is new to him. It seems like a jumble of
      meaningless sounds until he learns, not only to understand the words, but
      also to distinguish the sentences. Temples and palaces, statues and
      columns appear everywhere in motley confusion. Each one, if you separate
      it from the whole and give it a careful examination, is worthy of
      inspection, nay, of admiration. Here are light, graceful creations of
      Hellenic, yonder heavy, sombre ones of Egyptian art, and in the background
      the exquisite azure of the eternal sea, which the marvellous structure of
      the heptastadium unites to the land; while on the island of Pharos the
      lighthouse of Sostratus towers aloft almost to the sky, and with a flood
      of light points out the way to mariners who approach the great harbour at
      night. Countless vessels are also at anchor in the Eunostus. The riches of
      the whole earth flow into both havens. And the life and movement there and
      in the inland harbour on Lake Mareotis, where the Nile boats land! From
      early until late, what a busy throng, what an abundance of wares&mdash;and
      how many of the most valuable goods are made in our own city! for whatever
      useful, fine, and costly articles industrial art produces are manufactured
      here. The roof has not yet been put on many a factory in which busy
      workers are already making beautiful things. Here the weaver&rsquo;s shuttle
      flies, yonder gold is spun around slender threads of sheep guts, elsewhere
      costly materials are embroidered by women&rsquo;s nimble fingers with the
      prepared gold thread. There glass is blown, or weapons and iron utensils
      are forged. Finely polished knives split the pith of the papyrus, and long
      rows of workmen and workwomen gum the strips together. No hand, no head is
      permitted to rest. In the Museum the brains of the great thinkers and
      investigators are toiling. Here, too, reality asserts its rights. The time
      for chimeras and wretched polemics is over. Now it is observing,
      fathoming, turning to account, nothing more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, my young friend,&rdquo; Proclus interrupted the artist. &ldquo;I know that
      you, too, sat at the feet of some of the philosophers in the Museum, and
      still uphold the teachings of Straton, which your fellow-pupil, King
      Ptolemy, outgrew long ago. Yet he, also, recognised in philosophy, first
      of all, the bond which unites the widely sundered acquisitions of the
      intellect, the vital breath which pervades them, the touchstone which
      proves each true or false. If the praise of Alexandria is to be sung, we
      must not forget the library to which the most precious treasures of
      knowledge of the East and West are flowing, and which feeds those who
      thirst for knowledge with the intellectual gains of former ages and other
      nations. Honour, too, to our King, and, that I may be just, to his
      illustrious wife; for wherever in the Grecian world a friend of the Muses
      appears, whether he is investigator, poet, architect, sculptor, artist,
      actor, or singer, he is drawn to Alexandria, and, that he may not be idle,
      work is provided. Palaces spring from the earth quickly enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet not like mushrooms,&rdquo; Hermon interrupted, &ldquo;but as the noblest, most
      carefully executed creations of art-sculpture and painting provide for
      their decoration both without and within.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; Proclus went on, &ldquo;abodes are erected for the gods as well as for
      men, both Egyptian and Hellenic divinities, each in their own style, and
      so beautiful that it must be a pleasure for them to dwell under the new
      roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the gardens of the Paneum, friends!&rdquo; cried young Philotas; and
      Hermon, nodding to Thyone, added gaily: &ldquo;Then you must climb the mountain
      and keep your eyes open while you are ascending the winding path. You will
      find enough to do to look at all the new sights. You will stand there with
      dry feet, but your soul will bathe in eternal, imperishable, divine
      beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foe of beauty!&rdquo; exclaimed Proclus, pointing to the sculptor with a
      scornful glance; but Daphne, full of joyous emotion, whispered to Hermon
      as he approached her: &ldquo;Eternal, divine beauty! To hear it thus praised by
      you makes me happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried the artist, &ldquo;what else should I call what has so often filled
      me with the deepest rapture? The Greek language has no more fitting
      expression for the grand and lofty things that hovered before me, and
      which I called by that chameleon of a word. Yet I have a different meaning
      from what appears before you at its sound. Were I to call it truth, you
      would scarcely understand me, but when I conjure before my soul the image
      of Alexandria, with all that springs from it, all that is moving,
      creating, and thriving with such marvellous freedom, naturalness, and
      variety within it, it is not alone the beauty that pleases the eye which
      delights me; I value more the sound natural growth, the genuine, abundant
      life. To truth, Daphne, as I mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his goblet as he spoke and drank to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She willingly pledged him, but, after removing her lips from the cup, she
      eagerly exclaimed: &ldquo;Show it to us, with the mind which animates it, in
      perfect form, and I should not know wherein it was to be distinguished
      from the beauty which hitherto has been our highest goal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the helmsman&rsquo;s loud shout, &ldquo;The light of Pelusium!&rdquo; interrupted the
      conversation. The bright glare from the lighthouse of this city was really
      piercing the misty night air, which for some time had again concealed the
      moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no further connected conversation, for the sea was now rising
      and falling in broad, leaden, almost imperceptible waves. The comfort of
      most of Philippus&rsquo;s guests was destroyed, and the ladies uttered a sigh of
      relief when they had descended from the lofty galley and the boats that
      conveyed them ashore, and their feet once more pressed the solid land. The
      party of travellers went to the commandant&rsquo;s magnificent palace to rest,
      and Hermon also retired to his room, but sleep fled from his couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one on earth was nearer to his heart and mind than Daphne, and it often
      seemed as if her kind, loyal, yet firm look was resting upon him; but the
      memory of Ledscha also constantly forced itself upon his mind and stirred
      his blood. When he thought of the menacing fire of her dark eyes, she
      seemed to him as terrible as one of the unlovely creatures born of Night,
      the Erinyes, Apate, and Eris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he could not help recalling their meetings in the grove of Astarte,
      her self-forgetting, passionate tenderness, and the wonderfully delicate
      beauty of her foreign type. True, she had never laughed in his presence;
      but what a peculiar charm there was in her smile! Had he really lost her
      entirely and forever? Would it not yet be possible to obtain her
      forgiveness and persuade her to pose as the model of his Arachne?
    </p>
    <p>
      During the voyage to Pelusium he had caught Althea&rsquo;s eye again and again,
      and rejected as an insult her demand to give her his whole love. The
      success of the Arachne depended upon Ledscha, and on her alone. He had
      nothing good to expect from the Demeter, and during the nocturnal
      meditation, which shows everything in the darkest colours, his best plan
      seemed to be to destroy the unsuccessful statue and not exhibit it for the
      verdict of the judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he went to work again in Tennis to model the Arachne, did not love
      for Daphne forbid him to sue afresh for Ledscha&rsquo;s favour?
    </p>
    <p>
      What a terrible conflict of feelings!
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps all this might gain a more satisfactory aspect by daylight.
      Now he felt as though he had entangled himself in a snare. Besides, other
      thoughts drove sleep from his couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window spaces were closed by wooden shutters, and whenever they moved
      with a low creaking or louder banging Hermon started and forgot everything
      else in anxiety about his invalid friend, whose suffering every strong
      wind brought on again, and often seriously increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three times he sprang up from the soft wool, covered with linen sheets,
      and looked out to convince himself that no storm had risen. But, though
      masses of black clouds concealed the moon and stars, and the sea beat
      heavily against the solid walls of the harbour, as yet only a sultry
      breeze of no great strength blew on his head as he thrust it into the
      night air.
    </p>
    <p>
      This weather could scarcely be dangerous to Myrtilus, yet when the morning
      relieved him from the torturing anxiety which he had found under his
      host&rsquo;s roof instead of rest and sleep, gray and black clouds were sweeping
      as swiftly over the port and the ramparts beside him as if they were
      already driven by a tempest, and warm raindrops besprinkled his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went, full of anxiety, to take his bath, and, while committing the care
      of the adornment of his outer man to one of the household slaves, he
      determined that unless&mdash;as often happened in this country&mdash;the
      sun gained the victory over the clouds, he would return to Tennis and join
      Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall of the men he met the rest of the old hero&rsquo;s guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      They received him pleasantly enough, Althea alone barely noticed his
      greeting; she seemed to suspect in what way he thought of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone and Daphne extended their hands to him all the more cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippus did not appear until after breakfast. He had been detained by
      important despatches from Alexandria, and by questions and communications
      from Proclus. The latter desired to ascertain whether the influential
      warrior who commanded the most important fortress in the country could be
      persuaded to join a conspiracy formed by Arsinoe against her royal
      husband, but he seemed to have left Philippus with very faint hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subordinate officers and messengers also frequently claimed the
      commandant&rsquo;s attention. When the market place was filling, however, the
      sturdy old soldier kindly fulfilled his duties as host by offering to show
      his guests the sights of the fortified seaport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon also accompanied him at Daphne&rsquo;s side, but he made it easy for
      Philotas to engross her attention; for, though the immense thickness of
      the walls and the arrangement of the wooden towers which, crowned with
      battlements, rose at long intervals, seemed to him also well worth seeing,
      he gave them only partial attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Philippus was showing the guests how safely the archers and slingers
      could be concealed behind the walls and battlements and discharge their
      missiles, and explaining the purpose of the great catapults on the
      outermost dike washed by the sea, the artist was listening to the
      ever-increasing roar of the waves which poured into the harbour from the
      open sea, to their loud dashing against the strong mole, to the shrill
      scream of the sea gulls, the flapping of the sails, which were being taken
      in everywhere&mdash;in short, to all the sounds occasioned by the rising
      violence of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were not a few war ships in the port and among them perfect giants
      of amazing size and unusual construction, but Hermon had already seen many
      similar ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, shortly after noon, the sun for a few brief moments pierced with
      scorching rays the dark curtain that shrouded it from sight, and then
      suddenly dense masses of clouds, driven from the sea by the tempest,
      covered the day star, his eyes and cars were engrossed entirely by the
      uproar of the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air darkened as if night was falling at this noontide hour, and with
      savage fury the foaming mountain waves rushed like mad wild beasts in
      fierce assault upon the mole, the walls, and the dikes of the fortified
      port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; cried Thyone, and again entered the litter which she had left to
      inspect the new catapults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Althea, trembling, drew her peplos together as the storm swept her light
      figure before it, and, shrieking, struggled against the black slaves who
      tried to lift her upon the war elephant which had borne her here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philotas gave his arm to Daphne. Hermon had ceased to notice her; he had
      just gone to his gray-haired host with the entreaty that he would give him
      a ship for the voyage to Tennis, where Myrtilus would need his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible in such weather,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will ride!&rdquo; cried Hermon resolutely, and Philippus scanned the son
      of his old friend and companion in arms with an expression of quiet
      satisfaction in his eyes, still sparkling brightly, and answered quickly,
      &ldquo;You shall have two horses, my boy, and a guide who knows the road
      besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning swiftly to one of the officers who accompanied him, he
      ordered him to provide what was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, soon after, in the impluvium, the tempest tore the velarium that
      covered the open space from its rings, and the ladies endeavoured to
      detain Hermon, Philippus silenced them with the remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A disagreeable ride is before him, but what urges him on is pleasing to
      the gods. I have just ventured to send out a carrier dove,&rdquo; he added,
      turning to the artist, &ldquo;to inform Myrtilus that he may expect you before
      sunset. The storm comes from the cast, otherwise it would hardly reach the
      goal. Put even if it should be lost, what does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thyone nodded to her old husband with a look of pleasure, and her eyes
      shone through tears at Hermon as she clasped his hand and, remembering her
      friend, his mother, exclaimed: &ldquo;Go, then, you true son of your father, and
      tell your friend that we will offer sacrifices for his welfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lean chicken to Aesculapius,&rdquo; whispered the grammateus to Althea. &ldquo;She
      holds on to the oboli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, at any rate, would be hard enough to dispose of in this wretched
      place unless one were a dealer in weapons or a thirsty sailor,&rdquo; sighed the
      Thracian. &ldquo;As soon as the sky and sea are blue again, chains could not
      keep me here. And the cooing around this insipid rich beauty into the
      bargain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark referred to Philotas, who was just offering Daphne a
      magnificent bunch of roses, which a mounted messenger had brought to him
      from Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl received it with a grateful glance, but she instantly separated
      one of the most beautiful blossoms from its companions and handed it to
      Hermon, saying, &ldquo;For our suffering friend, with my affectionate
      remembrances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The artist pressed her dear hand with a tender look of love, intended to
      express how difficult it was for him to leave her, and when, just at that
      moment, a slave announced that the horses were waiting, Thyone whispered:
      &ldquo;Have no anxiety, my son! Your ride away from her through the tempest will
      bring you a better reward than his slave&rsquo;s swift horse will bear the giver
      of the roses.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hermon, with the rose for his friend fastened in the breast folds of his
      chiton, mounted his horse gratefully, and his companion, a sinewy, bronzed
      Midianite, who was also to attend to the opening of the fortress gates,
      did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before reaching the open country the sculptor had to ride through the
      whole city, with which he was entirely unfamiliar. Fiercely as the storm
      was sweeping down the streets and squares, and often as the horseman was
      forced to hold on to his travelling hat and draw his chlamys closer around
      him, he felt the anxieties which had made his night sleepless and saddened
      his day suddenly leave him as if by a miracle. Was it the consciousness of
      having acted rightly? was it the friendly farewell which Daphne had given
      him, and the hope Thyone had aroused, or the expectation of seeing Ledscha
      once more, and at least regaining her good will, that had restored his
      lost light-heartedness? He did not know himself, nor did he desire to
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      While formerly he had merely glanced carelessly about him in Pelusium, and
      only half listened to the explanations given by the veteran&rsquo;s deep voice,
      now whatever he saw appeared in clear outlines and awakened his interest,
      in spite of the annoyances caused by the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he not known that he was in Pelusium, it would have been difficult for
      him to determine whether the city he was crossing was an Egyptian, a
      Hellenic, or a Syrian one; for here rose an ancient temple of the time of
      the Pharaohs, with obelisks and colossal statues before the lofty pylons,
      yonder the sanctuary of Poseidon, surrounded by stately rows of Doric
      columns, and farther on the smaller temple dedicated to the Dioscuri, and
      the circular Grecian building that belonged to Aphrodite.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another spot, still close to the harbour, he saw the large buildings
      consecrated to the worship of the Syrian Baal and Astarte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was obliged to wait awhile, for the tempest had excited the war
      elephants which were returning from their exercising ground, and their
      black keepers only succeeded with the utmost difficulty in restraining
      them. Shrieking with fear, the few persons who were in the street besides
      the soldiers, that were everywhere present, scattered before the huge,
      terrified animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The costume and appearance of the citizens, too, gave no clew to the
      country to which the place belonged; there were as many Egyptians among
      them as Greeks, Syrians, and negroes. Asiatics appeared in the majority
      only in the market place, where the dealers were just leaving their stands
      to secure their goods from the storm. In front of the big building where
      the famous Pelusinian xythus beer was brewed, the drink was being carried
      away in jugs and wineskins, in ox-carts and on donkeys. Here, too, men
      were loading camels, which were rarely seen in Egypt, and had been
      introduced there only a short time before.
    </p>
    <p>
      How forcibly all these things riveted Hermon&rsquo;s attention, now that no one
      was at hand to explain them and no delay was permitted! He scarcely had
      time for recollection and expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the last gate was unlocked, and the ramparts and moats lay behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far the wind had kept back the rain, and only scattered drops lashed
      the riders&rsquo; faces; but as soon as they entered the open country, it seemed
      as though the pent-up floods burst the barriers which retained them above,
      and a torrent of water such as only those dry regions know rushed, not in
      straight or slanting lines, but in thick streams, whirled by the
      hurricane, upon the marshy land which stretched from Pelusium to Tennis,
      and on the horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road led along a dike raised above fields which, at this season of the
      year, were under water, and Hermon&rsquo;s companion knew it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time both riders allowed themselves to be drenched in silence. The
      water ran down upon them from their broad-brimmed hats, and their dripping
      horses trotted with drooping heads and steaming flanks one behind the
      other until, at the very brick-kiln where Ledscha had recalled her widowed
      sister&rsquo;s unruly slaves to obedience, the guide stopped with an oath, and
      pointed to the water which had risen to the top of the dam, and in some
      places concealed the road from their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was no longer possible to trot, for the guide was obliged to seek
      the traces of the dike with great caution. Meanwhile the force of the
      pouring rain by no means lessened&mdash;nay, it even seemed to increase&mdash;and
      the horses were already wading in water up to their fetlocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the votive stones, the little altars and statues of the gods, the
      bushes and single trees along the sides of the dike road were overflowed
      while the travellers were in the region of the marsh, they would be
      obliged to interrupt their journey, for the danger of sinking into the
      morass with their horses would then threaten them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at the brick-kiln travellers, soldiers, and trains of merchandise had
      stopped to wait for the end of the cloud-burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the farmhouse, too, which Hermon and his companion next
      reached, they saw dozens of people seeking shelter, and the Midianite
      urged his master to join them for a short time at least. The wisest course
      here was probably to yield, and Hermon was already turning his horse&rsquo;s
      head toward the house when a Greek messenger dashed past the beckoning
      refuge and also by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare to ride farther?&rdquo; the artist shouted in a tone of warning
      inquiry to the man on the dripping bay, and the latter, without pausing,
      answered: &ldquo;Duty! On business for the King!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Hermon turned his steed back toward the road, beat the water from his
      soaked beard with the edge of his hand, and with a curt &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;
       announced his decision to his companion. Duty summoned him also, and what
      another risked for the King he would not fail to do for his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Midianite, shaking his head, rode angrily after him; but, though the
      violence of the rain was lessening, the wind began to blow with redoubled
      force, beating and lashing the boundless expanse of the quickly formed
      lake with such savage fury that it rolled in surges like the sea, and
      sweeping over it dense clouds of foam like the sand waves tossed by the
      desert tempests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes moaning, sometimes whistling, the gusts of the hurricane drove
      the water and the travellers before it, while the rain poured from the sky
      to the earth, and wherever it struck splashed upward, making little
      whirlpools and swiftly breaking bubbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      What might not Myrtilus suffer in this storm! This thought strengthened
      Hermon&rsquo;s courage to twice ride past other farmhouses which offered
      shelter. At the third the horse refused to wade farther in such a tempest,
      so there was nothing to be done except spring off and lead it to the
      higher ground which the water had not yet reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the peasant hut was filled with people who had sought
      shelter there, and the stifling atmosphere which the artist felt at the
      door induced him to remain outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stood there dripping barely fifteen minutes when loud shouts and
      yells were heard on the road from Pelusium by which he had come, and upon
      the flooded dike appeared a body of men rushing forward with marvellous
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearer they came the fiercer and more bewildering sounded the loud,
      shrill medley of their frantic cries, mingled with hoarse laughter, and
      the spectacle presented to the eyes was no less rough and bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority seemed to be powerful men. Their complexions were as light as
      the Macedonians; their fair, red, and brown locks were thick, unkempt, and
      bristling. Most of the reckless, defiantly bold faces were smooth-shaven,
      with only a mustache on the upper lip, and sometimes a short imperial. All
      carried weapons, and a fleece covered the shoulders of many, while chains,
      ornamented with the teeth of animals, hung on their white muscular chests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Galatians,&rdquo; Hermon heard one man near him call to another. &ldquo;They came to
      the fortress as auxiliary troops. Philippus forbade them to plunder on
      pain of death, and showed them&mdash;the gods be thanked!&mdash;that he
      was in earnest. Otherwise it would soon look here as though the plagues of
      locusts, flood, and fire had visited us at once. Red-haired men are not
      the only sons of Typhon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Hermon thought that he had indeed never seen any human beings equally
      fierce, bold to the verge of reckless madness, as these Gallic warriors.
      The tempest which swept them forward, and the water through which they
      waded, only seemed to increase their enjoyment, for sheer delight rang in
      their exulting shouts and yells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes! To march amid this uproar of the elements was a pleasure to the
      healthy men. It afforded them the rarest, most enlivening delight. For a
      long time nothing had so strongly reminded them of the roaring of the wind
      and the rushing of the rain in their northern home. It seemed a delicious
      relief, after the heat and dryness of the south, which they had endured
      with groans.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they perceived the eyes fixed upon them they swung their weapons,
      arched their breasts with conscious vanity, distorted their faces into
      terrible threatening grimaces, or raised bugle horns to their lips, drew
      from them shrill, ear-piercing notes and gloated, with childish delight,
      in the terror of the gaping crowd, on whom the restraint of authority
      sternly forbade them to show their mettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lust of rapine and greed for booty glittered in many a fiery, longing
      look, but their leaders kept them in check with the sword. So they rushed
      on without stopping, like a thunderstorm pregnant with destruction which
      the wind drives over a terrified village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon also had to take the road they followed, and, after giving the
      Gauls a long start, he set out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he succeeded in passing the marshy region without injury, there
      had been delay after delay; here the horses had left the flooded dike road
      and floundered up to their knees in the morass, there trees from the
      roadside, uprooted by the storm, barred the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As night closed in the rain ceased and the wind began to subside, but dark
      clouds covered the sky, and the horsemen were still an hour&rsquo;s ride from
      the place where the road ended at the little harbour from which travellers
      entered the boat which conveyed them to Tennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way no longer led through the marsh, but through tilled lands, and
      crossed the ditches which irrigated the fields on wooden bridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their account, in the dense darkness which prevailed, caution was
      necessary, and this the guide certainly did not lack. He rode at a slow
      walk in front of the artist, and had just pointed out to him the light at
      the landing place of the boat which went to Tennis, when Hermon was
      suddenly startled by a loud cry, followed by clattering and splashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      With swift presence of mind he sprang from his horse and found his
      conjecture verified. The bridge had broken down, and horse and rider had
      fallen into the broad canal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Galatians!&rdquo; reached Hermon from the dark depths, and the exclamation
      relieved him concerning the fate of the Midianite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter soon struggled up to the road uninjured. The bridge must have
      given way under the feet of the savage horde, unless the Gallic monsters,
      with brutal malice, had intentionally shattered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first supposition, however, seemed to be the correct one, for as
      Hermon approached the canal he heard moans of pain. One of the Gauls had
      apparently met with an accident in the fall of the bridge and been
      deserted by his comrades. With the skill acquired in the wrestling school,
      Hermon descended into the canal to look for the wounded man, while his
      guide undertook to get the horses ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep darkness considerably increased the difficulty of carrying out
      his purpose, but the young Greek went up to his neck in the water he could
      not become wetter than he was already. So he remained in the ditch until
      he found the injured man whose groans of suffering pierced his
      compassionate heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to release the luckless Gaul from the broken timbers of the
      bridge, and, when Hermon had dragged him out on the opposite bank of the
      canal, he made no answer to any question. A falling beam had probably
      struck him senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hair, which Hermon&rsquo;s groping fingers informed him was thick and rough,
      seemed to denote a Gaul, but a full, long beard was very rarely seen in
      this nation, and the wounded man wore one. Nor could anything be
      discovered from the ornaments or weapons of this fierce barbarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to whatever people he might belong, he certainly was not a Greek. The
      thoroughly un-Hellenic wrapping up of the legs proved that.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter! Hermon at any rate was dealing with some one who was severely
      injured, and the self-sacrificing pity with which even suffering animals
      inspired him, and which in his boyhood had drawn upon him the jeers of the
      companions of his own age, did not abandon him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly obeying his command, the Midianite helped him bandage the
      sufferer&rsquo;s head, in which a wound could be felt, as well as it could be
      done in the darkness, and lift him on the artist&rsquo;s horse. During this time
      fresh groans issued from the bearded lips of the injured warrior, and
      Hermon walked by his side, guarding the senseless man from the danger of
      falling from the back of the horse as it slowly followed the Midianite&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tiresome walk, however, did not last long; the landing place was
      reached sooner than Hermon expected, and the ferryboat bore the travellers
      and the horses to Tennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the flickering light of the captain&rsquo;s lantern it was ascertained that
      the wounded man, in spite of his long dark beard, was probably a Gaul. The
      stupor was to be attributed to the fall of a beam on his head, and the
      shock, rather than to the wound. The great loss of blood sustained by the
      young and powerful soldier had probably caused the duration of the swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the attempts at resuscitation a sailor boy offered his assistance.
      He carefully held the lantern, and, as its flickering light fell for brief
      moments upon the artist&rsquo;s face, the lad of thirteen or fourteen asked if
      he was Hermon of Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curt &ldquo;If you will permit,&rdquo; answered the question, considered by the
      Hellenes an unseemly one, especially from such a youth; but the sculptor
      paid no further attention to him, for, while devoting himself honestly to
      the wounded man, his anxiety about his invalid friend increased, and
      Ledscha&rsquo;s image also rose again before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the ferryboat touched the land, and when Hermon looked around for
      the lad he had already leaped ashore, and was just vanishing in the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably within an hour of midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gale was still blowing fiercely over the water, driving the black
      clouds across the dark sky, sometimes with long-drawn, wailing sounds,
      sometimes with sharp, whistling ones. The rain had wholly ceased, and
      seemed to have exhausted itself here in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Archias&rsquo;s white house was a considerable distance from the landing
      place of the ferryboat, Hermon had the wounded warrior carried to it by
      Biamite sailors, and again mounted his horse to ride to Myrtilus at as
      swift a trot as the soaked, wretched, but familiar road would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considerable time had been spent in obtaining a litter for the Gaul, yet
      Hermon was surprised to meet the lad who had questioned him so boldly on
      the ferryboat coming, not from the landing place, but running toward it
      again from the city, and then saw him follow the shore, carrying a blazing
      torch, which he waved saucily. The wind blew aside the flame and smoke
      which came from the burning pitch, but it shone brightly through the gloom
      and permitted the boy to be distinctly seen. Whence had the nimble fellow
      come so quickly? How had he succeeded, in this fierce gale, in kindling
      the torch so soon into a powerful flame? Was it not foolish to let a child
      amuse itself in the middle of the night with so dangerous a toy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon hastily thought over these questions, but the supposition that the
      light of the torch might be intended for a signal did not occur to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the boy and the light in his hand occupied his mind only a short
      time. He had better things to think of. With what longing Myrtilus must
      now be expecting his arrival! But the Gaul needed his aid no less urgently
      than his friend. Accurately as he knew what remedies relieved Myrtilus in
      severe attacks of illness, he could scarcely dispense with an assistant or
      a leech for the other, and the idea swiftly flashed upon him that the
      wounded man would afford him an opportunity of seeing Ledscha again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had told him more than once about the healing art possessed by old
      Tabus on the Owl&rsquo;s Nest. Suppose he should now seek the angry girl to
      entreat her to speak to the aged miracle-worker in behalf of the sorely
      wounded young foreigner?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he interrupted himself; something new claimed his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dim light glimmered through the intense darkness from a bit of rising
      ground by the wayside. It came from the Temple of Nemesis&mdash;a pretty
      little structure belonging to the time of Alexander the Great, which he
      had often examined with pleasure. Several steps led to the anteroom,
      supported by Ionic columns, which adjoined the naos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two lamps were burning at the side of the door leading into the little
      open cella, and at the back of the consecrated place the statue of the
      winged goddess was visible in the light of a small altar fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her right hand she held the bridle and scourge, and at her feet stood
      the wheel, whose turning indicates the influence exerted by her power upon
      the destiny of mortals. With stern severity that boded evil, she gazed
      down upon her left forearm, bent at the elbow, which corresponds with the
      ell, the just measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon certainly now, if ever, lacked both time and inclination to examine
      again this modest work of an ordinary artist, yet he quickly stopped his
      weary horse; for in the little pronaos directly in front of the cella door
      stood a slender figure clad in a long floating dark robe, extending its
      hands through the cella door toward the statue in fervent prayer. She was
      pressing her brow against the left post of the door, but at her feet, on
      the right side, cowered another figure, which could scarcely be recognised
      as a human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, too, was a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeply absorbed in her own thoughts, she was also extending her arms
      toward the statue of Nemesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon knew them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he fancied that his excited imagination was showing him a
      threatening illusion. But no!
    </p>
    <p>
      The erect figure was Ledscha, the crouching one Gula, the sailor&rsquo;s wife
      whose child he had rescued from the flames, and who had recently been cast
      out by her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ledscha!&rdquo; escaped his lips in a muttered tone, and he involuntarily
      extended his hands toward her as she was doing toward the goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not seem to hear him, and the other woman also retained the
      same attitude, as if hewn from stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he called the supplicant&rsquo;s name loud tone, and the next instant still
      more loudly; and now she turned, and, in the faint light of the little
      lamp, showed the marvellously noble outlines of her profile. He called
      again, and this time Ledscha heard anguished yearning in his deep tones;
      but they seemed to have lost their influence over her, for her large dark
      eyes gazed at him so repellently and sternly that a cold tremor ran down
      his spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swinging himself from his horse, he ascended the steps of the temple, and
      in the most tender tones at his command exclaimed: &ldquo;Ledscha! Severely as I
      have offended you, Ledscha&mdash;oh, do not say no! Will you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she answered firmly, and, before he could speak, continued: &ldquo;This
      place is ill chosen for another meeting! Your presence is hateful to me!
      Do not disturb me a moment longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you command,&rdquo; he began hesitatingly; but she swiftly interrupted with
      the question, &ldquo;Do you come from Pelusium, and are you going directly
      home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not heed the storm on account of Myrtilus&rsquo;s illness,&rdquo; he answered
      quietly, &ldquo;and if you demand it, I will return home at once; but first let
      me make one more entreaty, which will be pleasing also to the gods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get your response from yonder deity!&rdquo; she impatiently interrupted,
      pointing with a grand, queenly gesture, which at any other time would have
      delighted his artist eye, to the statue of Nemesis in the cella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Gula had also turned her face toward Hermon, and he now
      addressed her, saying with a faint tone of reproach: &ldquo;And did hatred lead
      you also, Gula, to this sanctuary at midnight to implore the goddess to
      destroy me in her wrath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young mother rose and pointed to Ledscha, exclaiming, &ldquo;She desires
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I?&rdquo; he asked gently. &ldquo;Have I really done you so much evil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her hand to her brow as if bewildered; her glance fell on the
      artist&rsquo;s troubled face, and lingered there for a short time. Then her eyes
      wandered to Ledscha, and from her to the goddess, and finally back again
      to the sculptor. Meanwhile Hermon saw how her young figure was trembling,
      and, before he had time to address a soothing-word to her, she sobbed
      aloud, crying out to Ledscha: &ldquo;You are not a mother! My child, he rescued
      it from the flames. I will not, and I can not&mdash;I will no longer pray
      for his misfortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her veil over her pretty, tear-stained face as she spoke, and
      darted lightly down the temple steps close beside him to seek shelter in
      her parents&rsquo; house, which had been unwillingly opened to the cast-off
      wife, but now afforded her a home rich in affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immeasurably bitter scorn was depicted in Ledscha&rsquo;s features as she gazed
      after Gula. She did not appear to notice Hermon, and when at last he
      appealed to her and briefly urged her to ask the old enchantress on the
      Owl&rsquo;s Nest for a remedy for the wounded Gaul, she again leaned against the
      post of the cella door, extended both arms with passionate fervour toward
      the goddess, and remained standing there motionless, deaf to his petition.
    </p>
    <p>
      His blood seethed in his veins, and he was tempted to go nearer and force
      her to hear him; but before he had ascended the first of the flight of
      steps leading to the pronaos, he heard the footsteps of the men who were
      bearing the wounded warrior after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must not see him here with one of their countrywomen at this hour,
      and manly pride forbade him to address her again as a supplicant.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went back to the road, mounted his horse, and rode on without
      vouchsafing a word of farewell to the woman who was invoking destruction
      upon his head. As he did so his eyes again rested on the stern face of
      Nemesis, and the wheel whose turning determined the destiny of men at her
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assailed by horrible fears, and overpowered by presentiments of evil, he
      pursued his way through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Myrtilus had succumbed to the terrible attack which must have
      visited him in such a storm, and life without his friend would be bereft
      of half its charm. Orphaned, poor, a struggler who had gained no complete
      victory, it had been rich only in disappointments to him, in spite of his
      conviction that he was a genuine artist, and was fighting for a good
      cause. Now he knew that he had also lost the woman by whose assistance he
      was certain of a great success in his own much-disputed course, and
      Ledscha, if any one, was right in expecting a favourable hearing from the
      goddess who punished injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not think of Daphne again until he was approaching the place where
      her tents had stood, and the remembrance of her fell like a ray of light
      into his darkened soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet on that spot had also been erected the wooden platform from which
      Althea had showed him the transformation into the spider, and the
      recollection of the foolish error into which the Thracian had drawn him
      disagreeably clouded the pleasant thought of Daphne.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Complete darkness enfolded the white house. Hermon saw only two windows
      lighted, the ones in his friend&rsquo;s studio, which looked out into the open
      square, while his own faced the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be nearly midnight, and he could no longer expect Myrtilus to be
      still at work. He had supposed that he should find him in his chamber,
      supported by his slaves, struggling for breath. What was the meaning of
      the light in the workrooms now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was his usually efficient Bias? He never went to rest when his
      master was to return home, yet the carrier dove must have announced his
      coming!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hermon had also enjoined the care of Myrtilus upon the slave, and he
      was undoubtedly beside the sufferer&rsquo;s couch, supporting him in the same
      way that he had often seen his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now riding across the open space, and he heard the men who carried
      the Gaul talking close behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the wounded barbarian the sole acquisition of this journey?
    </p>
    <p>
      The beat of his horse&rsquo;s hoofs and the voices of the Biamites echoed
      distinctly enough amid the stillness of the night, which was interrupted
      only by the roaring of the wind. And this disturbance of the deep silence
      around had entered the lighted windows before him, for a figure appeared
      at one of them, and&mdash;could he believe his own eyes?&mdash;Myrtilus
      looked down into the square, and a joyous welcome rang from his lips as
      loudly as in his days of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness of the night suddenly seemed to Hermon to be illumined. A
      leap to the ground, two bounds up the steps leading to the house, an eager
      rush through the corridor that separated him from the room in which
      Myrtilus was, the bursting instead of opening of the door, and, as if
      frantic with happy surprise, he impetuously embraced his friend, who,
      burin and file in hand, was just approaching the threshold, and kissed his
      brow and cheeks in the pure joy of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then what questions, answers, tidings! In spite of the torrents of rain
      and the gale, the invalid&rsquo;s health had been excellent. The solitude had
      done him good. He knew nothing about the carrier dove. The hurricane had
      probably &ldquo;blown it away,&rdquo; as the breeders of the swift messengers said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Question and reply now followed one another in rapid succession, and both
      were soon acquainted with everything worth knowing; nay, Hermon had even
      delivered Daphne&rsquo;s rose to his friend, and informed him what had befallen
      the Gaul who was being brought into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias and the other slaves had quickly appeared, and Hermon soon rendered
      the wounded man the help he needed in an airy chamber in the second story
      of the house, which, owing to the heat that prevailed in summer so close
      under the roof, the slaves had never occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias assisted his master with equal readiness and skill, and at last the
      Gaul opened his eyes and, in the language of his country, asked a few
      brief questions which were incomprehensible to the others. Then, groaning,
      he again closed his lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Hermon had not even allowed himself time to look around his
      friend&rsquo;s studio and examine what he had created during his absence. But,
      after perceiving that his kind act had not been in vain, and consuming
      with a vigorous appetite the food and wine which Bias set before him, he
      obliged Myrtilus&mdash;for another day was coming&mdash;to go to rest,
      that the storm might not still prove hurtful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he held his friend&rsquo;s hand in a firm clasp for a long time, and, when
      the latter at last prepared to go, he pressed it so closely that it
      actually hurt Myrtilus. But he understood his meaning, and, with a loving
      glance that sank deep into Hermon&rsquo;s heart, called a last good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two sleepless nights and the fatiguing ride which he had just taken,
      the sculptor felt weary enough; but when he laid his hand on the Gaul&rsquo;s
      brow and breast, and felt their burning heat, he refused Bias&rsquo;s voluntary
      offer to watch the sufferer in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      If to amuse or forget himself he had caroused far more nights in
      succession in Alexandria, why should he not keep awake when the object in
      question was to wrest a young life from the grasp of death? This man and
      his life were now his highest goal, and he had never yet repented his
      foolish eccentricity of imposing discomforts upon himself to help the
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias, on his part, was very willing to go to rest. He had plenty of cause
      for weariness; Myrtilus&rsquo;s unscrupulous body-servant had stolen off with
      the other slaves the night before, and did not return, with staggering
      gait, until the next morning, but, in order to keep his promise to his
      master, he had scarcely closed his eyes, that he might be at hand if
      Myrtilus should need assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bias fell asleep quickly enough in his little room in the lower story,
      while his master, by the exertion of all his strength of will, watched
      beside the couch of the Gaul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, after the first quarter of an hour, his head, no matter how he
      struggled to prevent it, drooped again and again upon his breast. But just
      as slumber was completely overpowering him his patient made him start up,
      for he had left his bed, and when Hermon, fully roused, looked for him,
      was standing in the middle of the room, gazing about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist thought that fever had driven the wounded warrior from his
      couch, as it formerly did his fellow-pupil Lycon, whom, in the delirium of
      typhus, he could keep in bed only by force. So he led the Gaul carefully
      back to the couch he had deserted, and, after moistening the bandage with
      healing balm from Myrtilus&rsquo;s medicine chest, ordered him to keep quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barbarian yielded as obediently as a child, but at first remained in a
      sitting posture and asked, in scarcely intelligible broken Greek, how he
      came to this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hermon had satisfied his curiosity, he also put a few questions, and
      learned that his charge not only wore a mustache, like his fellow
      countrymen, but also a full beard, because the latter was the badge of the
      bridge builders, to which class he belonged. While examining the one
      crossing the canal, it had fallen in upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes as he spoke, and Hermon wondered if it was not time for
      him to lie down also; but the wounded man&rsquo;s brow was still burning, and
      the Gallic words which he constantly muttered were probably about the
      phantoms of fever, which Hermon recognised from Lycon&rsquo;s illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he resolved to wait and continue to devote the night, which he had
      already intended to give him, to the sufferer. From the chair at the foot
      of the bed he looked directly into his face. The soft light of the lamp,
      which with two others hung from a tall, heavy bronze stand in the shape of
      an anchor, which Bias had brought, shone brightly enough to allow him to
      perceive how powerful was the man whose life he had saved. His own face
      was scarcely lighter in hue than the barbarian&rsquo;s, and how sharp was the
      contrast between his long, thick black beard and his white face and bare
      arched chest!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon had noticed this same contrast in his own person. Otherwise the
      Gaul did not resemble him in a single feature, and he might even have
      refused to compare his soft, wavy beard with the harsh, almost bristly one
      of the barbarian. And what a defiant, almost evil expression his
      countenance wore when&mdash;perhaps because his wound ached&mdash;he
      closed his lips more firmly! The children who so willingly let him,
      Hermon, take them in his arms would certainly have been afraid of this
      savage-looking fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in build, and at any rate in height and breadth of shoulders, there
      was some resemblance between him and the Gaul.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a bridge builder, the injured man belonged, in a certain sense, to the
      ranks of the artists, and this increased Hermon&rsquo;s interest in his patient,
      who was now probably out of the most serious danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, the Greek still cast many a searching glance at the barbarian, but
      his eyes closed more and more frequently, and at last the idea took
      possession of him that he himself was the wounded man on the couch, and
      some one else, who again was himself, was caring for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He vainly strove to understand the impossibility of this division of his
      own being, but the more eagerly he did so the greater became his
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the scene changed; Ledscha had appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending over him, she lavished words of love; but when, in passionate
      excitement, he sprang from the couch to draw her toward him, she changed
      into the Nemesis to whose statue she had just prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still as if petrified, and the goddess, too, did not stir. Only
      the wheel which had rested at her feet began to move, and rolled, with a
      thundering din, sometimes around him, sometimes around the people who, as
      if they had sprung from the ground, formed a jeering company of
      spectators, and clapped their hands, laughed, and shouted whenever it
      rolled toward him and he sprang back in fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the wheel constantly grew larger, and seemed to become heavier,
      for the wooden beams over which it rolled splintered, crashing like thin
      laths, and the spectators&rsquo; shouts of applause sounded ruder and fiercer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then mortal terror suddenly seized him, and while he shouted for help to
      Myrtilus, Daphne, and her father Archias, his slave Bias, the old comrade
      of Alexander, Philippus, and his wife, he awoke, bathed in perspiration,
      and looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he must still be under the spell of the horrible dream, for the
      rattling and clattering around him continued, and the bed where the
      wounded Gaul had lain was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon involuntarily dipped his hand into the water which stood ready to
      wet the bandages, and sprinkled his own face with it; but if he had ever
      beheld life with waking eyes, he was doing so now. Yet the barbarian had
      vanished, and the noise in the house still continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that rats and mice&mdash;? No! That was the shriek of a
      terrified human being&mdash;that a cry for help! This sound was the
      imperious command of a rough man&rsquo;s voice, that&mdash;no, he was not
      mistaken&mdash;that was his own name, and it came from the lips of his
      Myrtilus, anxiously, urgently calling for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he suddenly realized that the white house had been attacked, that his
      friend must be rescued from robbers or the fury of a mob of Biamites, and,
      like the bent wood of a projectile when released from the noose which
      holds it to the ground, the virile energy that characterized him sprang
      upward with mighty power. The swift glance that swept the room was sent to
      discover a weapon, and before it completed the circuit Hermon had already
      grasped the bronze anchor with the long rod twined with leaves and the
      teeth turned downward. Only one of the three little vessels filled with
      oil that hung from it was burning. Before swinging the heavy standard
      aloft, he freed it from the lamps, which struck the floor with a clanging
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man to whom he dealt a blow with this ponderous implement would forget
      to rise. Then, as if running for a prize in the gymnasium, he rushed
      through the darkness to the staircase, and with breathless haste groped
      his way down the narrow, ladderlike steps. He felt himself an avenging,
      punishing power, like the Nemesis who had pursued him in his dreams. He
      must wrest the friend who was to him the most beloved of mortals from the
      rioters. To defeat them himself seemed a small matter. His shout&mdash;&ldquo;I
      am coming, Myrtilus! Snuphis, Bias, Dorcas, Syrus! here, follow me!&rdquo; was
      to summon the old Egyptian doorkeeper and the slaves, and inform his
      friend of the approach of a deliverer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loudest uproar echoed from his own studio. Its door stood wide open,
      and black smoke, mingled with the deep red and yellow flames of burning
      pitch, poured from it toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myrtilus!&rdquo; he shouted at the top of his voice as he leaped across the
      threshold into the tumult which filled the spacious apartment, at the same
      time clashing the heavy iron anchor down upon the head of the
      broad-shouldered, half-naked fellow who was raising a clumsy lance against
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirate fell as though struck by lightning, and he again shouted
      &ldquo;Myrtilus!&rdquo; into the big room, so familiar to him, where the conflict was
      raging chaotically amid a savage clamour, and the smoke did not allow him
      to distinguish a single individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time he swung the terrible weapon, and it struck to the
      floor the monster with a blackened face who had rushed toward him, but at
      the same time the anchor broke in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a short metal rod remained in his hand, and, while he raised his arm,
      determined to crush the temples of the giant carrying a torch who sprang
      forward to meet him, it suddenly seemed as if a vulture with glowing
      plumage and burning beak was attacking his face, and the terrible bird of
      prey was striking its hard, sharp, red-hot talons more and more furiously
      into his lips, cheeks, and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first a glare as bright as sunshine had flashed before his gaze; then,
      where he had just seen figures and things half veiled by the smoke, he
      beheld only a scarlet surface, which changed to a violet, and finally a
      black spot, followed by a violet-blue one, while the vulture continued to
      rend his face with beak and talons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the name &ldquo;Myrtilus!&rdquo; once more escaped his lips; this time, however,
      it did not sound like the encouraging shout of an avenging hero, but the
      cry for aid of one succumbing to defeat, and it was soon followed by a
      succession of frantic outbursts of suffering, terror, and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now sharp whistles from the water shrilly pierced the air and
      penetrated into the darkened room, and, while the tumult around Hermon
      gradually died away, he strove, tortured by burning pain, to grope his way
      toward the door; but here his foot struck against a human body, there
      against something hard, whose form he could not distinguish, and finally a
      large object which felt cool, and could be nothing but his Demeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she seemed doomed to destruction, for the smoke was increasing every
      moment, and constantly made his open wounds smart more fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a cooler air fanned his burning face, and at the same time he
      heard hurrying steps approach and the mingled cries of human voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he began to shout the names of his friends, the slaves, and the
      porter; but no answer came from any of them, though hasty questions in the
      Greek language fell upon his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strategist, with his officers, the nomarch of the district with his
      subordinates, and many citizens of Tennis had arrived. Hermon knew most of
      them by their voices, but their figures were not visible. The red, violet,
      and black cloud before him was all he could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, although the pain continued to torture him, and a voice in his soul
      told him that he was blinded, he did not allow the government officials
      who eagerly surrounded him to speak, only pointed hastily to his eyes, and
      then bade them enter Myrtilus&rsquo;s studio. The Egyptian Chello, the Tennis
      goldsmith, who had assisted the artists in the preparation of the noble
      metal, and one of the police officers who had been summoned to rid the old
      house of the rats and mice which infested it, both knew the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must first try to save Myrtilus&rsquo;s work and, when that was
      accomplished, preserve his also from destruction by the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning on the goldsmith&rsquo;s arm, Hermon went to his friend&rsquo;s studio; but
      before they reached it smoke and flames poured out so densely that it was
      impossible even to gain the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Destroyed&mdash;a prey to the flames!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;And he&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then like a madman he asked if no one had seen Myrtilus, and where he was;
      but in vain, always in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the goldsmith who was leading him asked him to move aside, for all
      who had flocked to the white house when it was seized by the flames had
      joined in the effort to save the statue of Demeter, which they had found
      unharmed in his studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventeen men, by the exertion of all their strength, were dragging the
      heavy statue from the house, which was almost on the point of falling in,
      into the square. Several others were bearing corpses into the open air-the
      old porter Snuphis and Myrtilus&rsquo;s body servant. Some motionless forms they
      were obliged to leave behind. Both the bodies had deep wounds. There was
      no trace of Myrtilus and Bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the storm had subsided, and a cool breeze blew refreshingly into
      Hermon&rsquo;s face. As he walked arm in arm with the notary Melampus, who had
      invited him to his house, and heard some one at his side exclaim, &ldquo;How
      lavishly Eos is scattering her roses to-day!&rdquo; he involuntarily lifted the
      cloth with which he had covered his smarting face to enjoy the beautiful
      flush of dawn, but again beheld nothing save a black and violet-blue
      surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then drawing his hand from his guide&rsquo;s arm, he pressed it upon his poor,
      sightless, burning eyes, and in helpless rage, like a beast of prey which
      feels the teeth of the hunter&rsquo;s iron trap rend his flesh, groaned
      fiercely, &ldquo;Blind! blind!&rdquo; and again, and yet again, &ldquo;Blind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the morning star was still paling, the lad who after Hermon&rsquo;s
      landing had raced along the shore with the burning torch glided into the
      little pronaos of the Temple of Nemesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha was still standing by the doorpost of the cella with uplifted
      hand, so deeply absorbed in fervent prayer that she did not perceive the
      approach of the messenger until he called her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Succeeded?&rdquo; she asked in a muffled tone, interrupting his hasty greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must give the goddess what you vowed,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Hanno sends
      you the message. And also, &lsquo;You must come with me in the boat quickly-at
      once!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; the girl demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on board the Hydra yet,&rdquo; replied the boy hurriedly. &ldquo;First only to
      the old man on the Megara. The dowry is ready for your father. But there
      is not a moment to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; she gasped hoarsely. &ldquo;But, first, shall I find the man with
      the black beard on board of one of the ships?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; answered the lad proudly, grasping her arm to hurry her; but
      she shook him off violently, turned toward the cella again, and once more
      lifted her hands and eyes to the statue of Nemesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she took up the bundle she had hidden behind a pillar, drew from it a
      handful of gold coins, which she flung into the box intended for
      offerings, and followed the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive?&rdquo; she asked as she descended the steps; but the lad understood the
      meaning of the question, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Yes, indeed! Hanno says the
      wounds are not at all dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a scratch. On the Hydra, with two severely wounded slaves. The porter
      and the others were killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the statues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They-such things can&rsquo;t be accomplished without some little blunder-Labaja
      thinks so, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they escape you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one. I myself helped to smash the other, which stood in the workroom
      that looks out upon the water. The gold and ivory are on the ship. We had
      horrible work with the statue which stood in the room whose windows faced
      the square. They dragged the great monster carefully into the studio that
      fronts upon the water. But probably it is still standing there, if the
      thing is not already&mdash;just see how the flames are whirling upward!&mdash;if
      it is not already burned with the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a misfortune!&rdquo; Ledscha reproachfully exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could not be helped,&rdquo; the boy protested. &ldquo;People from Tennis suddenly
      rushed in. The first&mdash;a big, furious fellow-killed our Loule and the
      fierce Judas. Now he has to pay for it. Little Chareb threw the black
      powder into his eyes, while Hanno himself thrust the torch in his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bias, the blackbeard&rsquo;s slave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Oh, yes! Wounded, I believe, on board the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the lad, a precocious fourteen-year-old cabin-boy from the
      Hydra, pointed to the boat which lay ready, and took Ledscha&rsquo;s bundle in
      his hand; but she sprang into the light skiff before him and ordered it to
      be rowed to the Owl&rsquo;s Nest, where she must bid Mother Tabus good-bye. The
      cabin-boy, however, declared positively that the command could not be
      obeyed now, and at his signal two black sailors urged it with swift oar
      strokes toward the northwest, to Satabus&rsquo;s ship. Hanno wished to receive
      his bride as a wife from his father&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha had not insisted upon the fulfilment of her desire, but as the
      boat passed the Pelican Island her gaze rested on the lustreless waning
      disk of the moon. She thought of the torturing night, during which she had
      vainly waited here for Hermon, and a triumphant smile hovered around her
      lips; but soon the heavy eyebrows of the girl who was thus leaving her
      home contracted in a frown&mdash;she again fancied she saw, where the moon
      was just fading, the body of a gigantic, hideous spider. She banished the
      illusion by speaking to the boy&mdash;spiders in the morning mean
      misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early dawn, which was now crimsoning the east, reminded her of the
      blood which, as an avenger, she must yet shed.

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the market place in Tennis was filling, Archias&rsquo;s white house had
      become a heap of smouldering ruins. Hundreds of men and women were
      standing around the scene of the conflagration, but no one saw the statue
      of Demeter, which had been removed from Hermon&rsquo;s studio just in time. The
      nomarch had had it locked up in the neighbouring temple of the goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rumoured that the divinity had saved her own statue by a miracle;
      Pamaut, the police officer, said that he had seen her himself as,
      surrounded by a brilliant light, she soared upward on the smoke that
      poured from the burning house. The strategist and the nomarch used every
      means in their power to capture the robbers, but without the least
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it had become known that Paseth, Gula&rsquo;s husband, had cast off his wife
      because she had gone to Hermon&rsquo;s studio, the magistrates believed that the
      attack had been made by the Biamites; yet Paseth was absent from the city
      during the assault, and the innocence of the others could also be proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since, for two entire years, piracy had entirely ceased in this
      neighbourhood, no one thought of corsairs, and the bodies of the
      incendiaries having been consumed by the flames with the white house, it
      could not be ascertained to what class the marauders belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blinded sculptor could only testify that one of the robbers was a
      negro, or at any rate had had his face blackened, and that the size of
      another had appeared to him almost superhuman. This circumstance gave rise
      to the fable that, during the terrible storm of the previous clay, Hades
      had opened and spirits of darkness had rushed into the studio of the Greek
      betrayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strategist, it is true, did not believe such tales, but the
      superstition of the Biamites, who, moreover, aided the Greeks reluctantly
      to punish a crime which threatened to involve their own countrymen, put
      obstacles in the way of his measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until he heard of Ledscha&rsquo;s disappearance, and was informed by the
      priest of Nemesis of the handsome sum which had been found in the offering
      box of the temple shortly after the attack, did he arrive at a conjecture
      not very far from the real state of affairs; only it was still
      incomprehensible to him what body of men could have placed themselves at
      the disposal of a girl&rsquo;s vengeful plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day after the fire, the epistrategus of the whole Delta, who
      had accidentally come to the border fortress, arrived at Tennis on the
      galley of the commandant of Pelusium, and with him Proclus, the grammateus
      of the Dionysian artists, the Lady Thyone, Daphne, and her companion
      Chrysilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old hero Philippus was detained in the fortress by the preparations
      for war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Althea had returned to Alexandria, and Philotas, who disliked her, had
      gone there himself, as Chrysilla intimated to him that he could hope for
      no success in his suit to her ward so long as Daphne had to devote herself
      to the care of the blinded Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The epistrategus proceeded with great caution, but his efforts also
      remained futile. He ordered a report to be made of all the vessels which
      had entered the harbours and bays of the northeastern Delta, but those
      commanded by Satabus and his sons gave no cause for investigation; they
      had come into the Tanite arm of the Nile as lumber ships from Pontus, and
      had discharged beams and planks for the account of a well-known commercial
      house in Sinope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the official ordered the Owl&rsquo;s Nest to be searched. In doing this he
      made himself guilty of an act of violence, as the island&rsquo;s right of asylum
      still existed, and this incensed the irritable and refractory Biamites the
      more violently, the deeper was the reverent awe with which the nation
      regarded Tabus, who, according to their belief, was over a hundred years
      old. The Biamites honoured her not only as an enchantress and a leech, but
      as the ancestress of a race of mighty men. By molesting this aged woman,
      and interfering with an ancient privilege, the epistrategus lost the aid
      of the hostile fishermen, sailors, and weavers. Any information from their
      ranks to him was regarded as treachery; and, besides, his stay in Tennis
      could be but brief, as the King, on account of the impending war, had
      summoned him back to the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day after his arrival he left Tennis and sailed from Tanis
      for Alexandria. He had had little time to attend to Thyone and her guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proclus, too, could not devote himself to them until after the departure
      of the epistrategus, since he had gone immediately to Tanis, where, as
      head of the Dionysian artists of all Egypt, he had been occupied in
      attending to the affairs of the newly established theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to Tennis he had instantly requested to be conducted to the
      Temple of Demeter, to inspect the blinded Hermon&rsquo;s rescued work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had entered the cella of the sanctuary with the expectation of finding
      a peculiar, probably a powerful work, but one repugnant to his taste, and
      left it fairly overpowered by the beauty of this noble work of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he had formerly seen of Hermon&rsquo;s productions had prejudiced him
      against the artist, whose talent was great, but who, instead of dedicating
      it to the service of the beautiful and the sublime, chose subjects which,
      to Proclus, did not seem worthy of artistic treatment, or, when they were,
      sedulously deprived them of that by which, in his eyes, they gained
      genuine value. In Hermon&rsquo;s Olympian Banquet he&mdash;who also held the
      office of a high priest of Apollo in Alexandria&mdash;had even seen an
      insult to the dignity of the deity. In the Street Boy Eating Figs, the
      connoisseur&rsquo;s eye had recognised a peculiar masterpiece, but he had been
      repelled by this also; for, instead of a handsome boy, it represented a
      starving, emaciated vagabond.
    </p>
    <p>
      True to life as this figure might be, it seemed to him reprehensible, for
      it had already induced others to choose similar vulgar subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      When recently at Althea&rsquo;s performance he had met Hermon and saw how
      quickly his beautiful travelling companion allowed herself to be induced
      to bestow the wreath on the handsome, black-bearded fellow, it vexed him,
      and he had therefore treated him with distant coldness, and allowed him to
      perceive the disapproval which the direction taken by his art had awakened
      in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the presence of Hermon&rsquo;s Demeter, the opinion of the experienced man
      and intelligent connoisseur had suddenly changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creator of this work was not only one of the foremost artists of his
      day, nay, he had also been permitted to fathom the nature of the deity and
      to bestow upon it a perfect form.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Demeter was the most successful personification of the divine
      goodness which rewards the sowing of seed with the harvest. When Hermon
      created it, Daphne&rsquo;s image had hovered before his mind, even if he had not
      been permitted to use her as a model, and of all the maidens whom he knew
      there was scarcely one better suited to serve as the type for the Demeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what he had seen in Pelusium, and learned from women, was true. The
      heart and mind of the artist who had created this work were not filled
      with the image of Althea&mdash;who during the journey had bestowed many a
      mark of favour upon the aging man, and with whom he was obliged to work
      hand in hand for Queen Arsinoe&rsquo;s plans&mdash;but the daughter of Archias,
      and this circumstance also aided in producing his change of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon&rsquo;s blindness, it was to be hoped, would be cured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duty, and perhaps also interest, commanded him to show him frankly how
      highly he estimated his art and his last work.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the arrival of Thyone and Daphne, Hermon had consented to accompany
      them on board the Proserpina, their spacious galley. True, he had yielded
      reluctantly to this arrangement of his parents&rsquo; old friend, and neither
      she nor Daphne had hitherto succeeded in soothing the fierce resentment
      against fate which filled his soul after the loss of his sight and his
      dearest friend. As yet every attempt to induce him to bear his terrible
      misfortune with even a certain degree of composure had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tennis leech, trained by the Egyptian priests at Sais in the art of
      healing, who was attached as a pastophorus to the Temple of Isis, in the
      city of weavers, had covered the artist&rsquo;s scorched face with bandages, and
      earnestly adjured him never in his absence to raise them, and to keep
      every ray of light from his blinded eyes. But the agitation which had
      mastered Hermon&rsquo;s whole being was so great that, in spite of the woman&rsquo;s
      protestations, he lifted the covering again and again to see whether he
      could not perceive once more at least a glimmer of the sunlight whose
      warming power he felt. The thought of living in darkness until the end of
      his life seemed unendurable, especially as now all the horrors which,
      hitherto, had only visited him in times of trial during the night assailed
      him with never-ceasing cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image of the spider often forced itself upon him, and he fancied that
      the busy insect was spreading its quickly made web over his blinded eyes,
      which he was not to touch, yet over which he passed his hand to free them
      from the repulsive veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The myth related that because Athene&rsquo;s blow had struck the ambitious
      weaver Arachne, she had resolved, before the goddess transformed her into
      a spider, to put an end to her disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      How infinitely harder was the one dealt to him! How much better reason he
      had to use the privilege in which man possesses an advantage over the
      immortals, of putting himself to death with his own hand when he deems the
      fitting time has come! What should he, the artist, to whom his eyes
      brought whatever made life valuable, do longer in this hideous black
      night, brightened by no sunbeam?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was often overwhelmed, too, by the remembrance of the terrible end of
      the friend in whom he saw the only person who might have given him
      consolation in this distress, and the painful thought of his poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was supported solely by what his art brought and his wealthy uncle
      allowed him. The Demeter which Archias had ordered had been partially paid
      for in advance, and he had intended to use the gold&mdash;a considerable
      sum&mdash;to pay debts in Alexandria. But it was consumed with the rest of
      his property&mdash;tools, clothing, mementoes of his dead parents, and a
      few books which contained his favourite poems and the writings of his
      master, Straton.
    </p>
    <p>
      These precious rolls had aided him to maintain the proud conviction of
      owing everything which he attained or possessed solely to himself. It had
      again become perfectly clear to him that the destiny of earth-born mortals
      was not directed by the gods whom men had invented after their own
      likeness, in order to find causes for the effects which they perceived,
      but by deaf and blind chance. Else how could even worse misfortune,
      according to the opinion of most people, have befallen the pure, guiltless
      Myrtilus, who so deeply revered the Olympians and understood how to honour
      them so magnificently by his art, than himself, the despiser of the gods?
    </p>
    <p>
      But was the death for which he longed a misfortune?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the Nemesis who had so swiftly and fully granted the fervent prayer of
      an ill-used girl also only an image conjured up by the power of human
      imagination?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was scarcely possible!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if there was one goddess, did not that admit the probability of the
      existence of all the others?
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered at the idea; for if the immortals thought, felt, acted, how
      terribly his already cruel fate would still develop! He had denied and
      insulted almost all the Olympians, and not even stirred a finger to the
      praise and honour of a single one.
    </p>
    <p>
      What marvel if they should choose him for the target of their resentment
      and revenge?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just believed that the heaviest misfortune which can befall a man
      and an artist had already stricken him. Now he felt that this, too, had
      been an error; for, like a physical pain, he realized the collapse of the
      proud delusion of being independent of every power except himself, freely
      and arbitrarily controlling his own destiny, owing no gratitude except to
      his own might, and being compelled to yield to nothing save the
      enigmatical, pitiless power of eternal laws or their co-operation, so
      incomprehensible to the human intellect, called &ldquo;chance,&rdquo; which took no
      heed of merit or unworthiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Must he, who had learned to silence and to starve every covetous desire,
      in order to require no gifts from his own uncle and his wealthy kinsman
      and friend, and be able to continue to hold his head high, as the most
      independent of the independent, now, in addition to all his other woe, be
      forced to believe in powers that exercised an influence over his every
      act? Must he recognise praying to them and thanking them as the demand of
      justice, of duty, and wisdom? Was this possible either?
    </p>
    <p>
      And, believing himself alone, since he could not see Thyone and Daphne,
      who were close by him, he struck his scorched brow with his clinched fist,
      because he felt like a free man who suddenly realizes that a rope which he
      can not break is bound around his hands and feet, and a giant pulls and
      loosens it at his pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet no! Better die than become for gods and men a puppet that obeys every
      jerk of visible and invisible hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting up in violent excitement, he tore the bandage from his face and
      eyes, declaring, as Thyone seriously reprimanded him, that he would go
      away, no matter where, and earn his daily bread at the handmill, like the
      blind Ethiopian slave whom he had seen in the cabinetmaker&rsquo;s house at
      Tennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Daphne spoke to him tenderly, but her soothing voice caused him
      keener pain than his old friend&rsquo;s stern one.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sit still longer seemed unendurable, and, with the intention of
      regaining his lost composure by pacing to and fro, he began to walk; but
      at the first free step he struck against the little table in front of
      Thyone&rsquo;s couch, and as it upset and the vessels containing water fell with
      it, clinking and breaking, he stopped and, as if utterly crushed, groped
      his way back, with both arms outstretched, to the armchair he had quitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he could only have seen Daphne press her handkerchief first to her
      eyes, from which tears were streaming, and then to her lips, that he might
      not hear her sobs, if he could have perceived how Thyone&rsquo;s wrinkled old
      face contracted as if she were swallowing a colocynth apple, while at the
      same time she patted his strong shoulder briskly, exclaiming with forced
      cheerfulness: &ldquo;Go on, my boy! The steed rears when the hornet stings! Try
      again, if it only soothes you! We will take everything out of your way.
      You need not mind the water-jars. The potter will make new ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Hermon threw back his burning head, rested it against the back of the
      chair, and did not stir until the bandage was renewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How comfortable it felt!
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, too, that he owed it to Daphne; the matron&rsquo;s fingers could not be
      so slender and delicate, and he would have been more than glad to raise
      them to his lips and thank her; but he denied himself the pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she really did love him, the bond between them must now be severed;
      for, even if her goodness of heart extended far enough to induce her to
      unite her blooming young existence to his crippled one, how could he have
      accepted the sacrifice without humiliating himself? Whether such a
      marriage would have made her happy or miserable he did not ask, but he was
      all the more keenly aware that if, in this condition, he became her
      husband, he would be the recipient of alms, and he would far rather, he
      mentally repeated, share the fate of the negro at the handmill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression of his features revealed the current of his thoughts to
      Daphne, and, much as she wished to speak to him, she forced herself to
      remain silent, that the tones of her voice might not betray how deeply she
      was suffering with him; but he himself now longed for a kind word from her
      lips, and he had just asked if she was still there when Thyone announced a
      visit from the grammateus Proclus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had recently felt that this man was unfriendly to him, and again his
      anger burst forth. To be exposed in the midst of his misery to the scorn
      of a despiser of his art was too much for his exhausted patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here he was interrupted by Proclus himself, who had entered the
      darkened cabin where the blind man remained very soon after Thyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon&rsquo;s last words had betrayed to the experienced courtier how well he
      remembered his unkind remarks, so he deferred the expression of his
      approval, and began by delivering the farewell message of the
      epistrategus, who had been summoned away so quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stated that his investigations had discovered nothing of importance,
      except, perhaps, the confirmation of the sorrowful apprehension that the
      admirable Myrtilus had been killed by the marauders. A carved stone had
      been found under the ashes, and Chello, the Tennis goldsmith, said he had
      had in his own workshop the gem set in the hapless artist&rsquo;s shoulder
      clasp, and supplied it with a new pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, he took Hermon&rsquo;s hand and gave him the stone, but the
      artist instantly used his finger tips to feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it really did belong to the clasp Myrtilus wore, for, although
      still unpractised in groping, he recognised that a human head was carved
      in relief upon the stone, and Mrytilus&rsquo;s had been adorned with the
      likeness of the Epicurean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damaged little work of art, in the opinion of Proclus and Daphne,
      appeared to represent this philosopher, and at the thought that his friend
      had fallen a victim to the flames Hermon bowed his head and exerted all
      his strength of will in order not to betray by violent sobs how deeply
      this idea pierced his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone, shrugging her shoulders mournfully, pointed to the suffering
      artist. Proclus nodded significantly, and, moving nearer to Hermon,
      informed him that he had sought out his Demeter and found the statue
      uninjured. He was well aware that it would be presumptuous to offer
      consolation in so heavy an affliction, and after the loss of his dearest
      friend, yet perhaps Hermon would be glad to hear his assurance that he,
      whose judgment was certainly not unpractised, numbered his work among the
      most perfect which the sculptor&rsquo;s art had created in recent years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself best know the value of this Demeter,&rdquo; the sculptor broke in
      harshly. &ldquo;Your praise is the bit of honey which is put into the mouth of
      the hurt child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend,&rdquo; Proclus protested with grave decision. &ldquo;I should express
      no less warmly the ardent admiration with which this noble figure of the
      goddess fills me if you were well and still possessed your sight. You were
      right just now when you alluded to my aversion, or, let us say, lack of
      appreciation of the individuality of your art; but this noble work changes
      everything, and nothing affords me more pleasure than that I am to be the
      first to assure you how magnificently you have succeeded in this statue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first!&rdquo; Hermon again interrupted harshly. &ldquo;But the second and third
      will be lacking in Alexandria. What a pleasure it is to pour the gifts of
      sympathy upon one to whom we wish ill! But, however successful my Demeter
      may be, you would have awarded the prize twice over to the one by
      Myrtilus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, my young friend!&rdquo; the statesman protested with honest zeal. &ldquo;All
      honour to the great dead, whose end was so lamentable; but in this contest&mdash;let
      me swear it by the goddess herself!&mdash;you would have remained victor;
      for, at the utmost, nothing can rank with the incomparable save a work of
      equal merit, and&mdash;I know life and art&mdash;two artists rarely or
      never succeed in producing anything so perfect as this masterpiece at the
      same time and in the same place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; gasped Hermon, hoarse with excitement; but Proclus, with
      increasing animation, continued: &ldquo;Brief as is our acquaintance, you have
      probably perceived that I do not belong to the class of flatterers, and in
      Alexandria it has hardly remained unknown to you that the younger artists
      number me, to whom the office of judge so often falls, among the sterner
      critics. Only because I desire their best good do I frankly point out
      their errors. The multitude provides the praise. It will soon flow upon
      you also in torrents, I can see its approach, and as this blindness, if
      the august Aesculapius and healing Isis aid, will pass away like a dreary
      winter night, it would seem to me criminal to deceive you about your own
      ability and success. I already behold you creating other works to the
      delight of gods and men; but this Demeter extorts boundless, enthusiastic
      appreciation; both as a whole, and in detail, it is faultless and worthy
      of the most ardent praise. Oh, how long it is, my dear, unfortunate
      friend, since I could congratulate any other Alexandrian with such joyful
      confidence upon the most magnificent success! Every word&mdash;you may
      believe it!&mdash;which comes to you in commendation of this last work
      from lips unused to eulogy is sincerely meant, and as I utter it to you I
      shall repeat it in the presence of the King, Archias, and the other
      judges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne, with hurried breath, deeply flushed cheeks, and sparkling eyes,
      had fairly hung upon the lips of the clever connoisseur. She knew Proclus,
      and his dreaded, absolutely inconsiderate acuteness, and was aware that
      this praise expressed his deepest conviction. Had he been dissatisfied
      with the statue of Demeter, or even merely superficially touched by its
      beauty, he might have shrunk from wounding the unfortunate artist by
      censure, and remained silent; but only something grand, consummate, could
      lead him to such warmth of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now felt it a misfortune that she and Thyone had hitherto been
      prevented, by anxiety for their patient, from admiring his work. Had it
      still been light, she would have gone to the temple of Demeter at once;
      but the sun had just set, and Proclus was obliged to beg her to have
      patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the cases were standing finished at the cabinetmaker&rsquo;s, the statue had
      been packed immediately, under his own direction, and carried on board his
      ship, which would convey it with him to the capital the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this arrangement called forth loud expressions of regret from Daphne
      and the vivacious matron, Hermon assented to it, for it would at least
      secure the ladies, until their arrival in Alexandria, from a painful
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; Proclus protested with firm dissent, &ldquo;it will rob you for some
      time of a great pleasure, and you, noble daughter of Archias, probably of
      the deepest emotion of gratitude with which the favour of the immortals
      has hitherto rendered you happy; yet the master who created this genuine
      goddess owes the best part of it to your own face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me himself that he thought of me while at work,&rdquo; Daphne admitted,
      and a flood of the warmest love reached Hermon&rsquo;s ears in her agitated
      tones, while, greatly perplexed, he wondered with increasing anxiety
      whether the stern critic Proclus had really been serious in the
      extravagant eulogium, so alien to his reputation in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myrtilus, too, had admired the head of his Demeter, and&mdash;this he
      himself might admit&mdash;he had succeeded in it, and yet ought not the
      figure, with its too pronounced inclination forward, which, it is true,
      corresponded with Daphne&rsquo;s usual bearing, and the somewhat angular bend of
      the arms, have induced this keen-sighted connoisseur to moderate the
      exalted strain of his praise? Or was the whole really so admirable that it
      would have seemed petty to find fault with the less successful details? At
      any rate, Proclus&rsquo;s eulogy ought to give him twofold pleasure, because his
      art had formerly repelled him, and Hermon tried to let it produce this
      effect upon him. But it would not do; he was continually overpowered by
      the feeling that under the enthusiastic homage of the intriguing Queen
      Arsinoe&rsquo;s favourite lurked a sting which he should some day feel. Or could
      Proclus have been persuaded by Thyone and Daphne to help them reconcile
      the hapless blind man to his hard fate?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon&rsquo;s every movement betrayed the great anxiety which filled his mind,
      and it by no means escaped Proclus&rsquo;s attention, but he attributed it to
      the blinded sculptor&rsquo;s anguish in being prevented, after so great a
      success, from pursuing his art further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely touched, he laid his slender hand on the sufferer&rsquo;s muscular
      arm, saying: &ldquo;A more severe trial than yours, my young friend, can
      scarcely be imposed upon the artist who has just attained the highest
      goal, but three things warrant you to hope for recovery&mdash;your
      vigorous youth, the skill of our Alexandrian leeches, and the favour of
      the immortal gods. You shrug your shoulders? Yet I insist that you have
      won this favour by your Demeter. True, you owe it less to yourself than to
      yonder maiden. What pleasure it affords one whom, like myself, taste and
      office bind to the arts, to perceive such a revolution in an artist&rsquo;s
      course of creation, and trace it to its source! I indulged myself in it
      and, if you will listen, I should like to show you the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; replied Hermon dully, bowing his head as if submitting to the
      inevitable, while Proclus began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hitherto your art imitated, not without success, what your eyes showed
      you, and if this was filled with the warm breath of life, your work
      succeeded. All respect to your Boy Eating Figs, in whose presence you
      would feel the pleasure he himself enjoyed while consuming the sweet
      fruit. Here, among the works of Egyptian antiquity, there is imminent
      danger of falling under the tyranny of the canon of proportions which can
      be expressed in figures, or merely even the demands of the style hallowed
      by thousands of years, but in a subject like the &lsquo;Fig-eater&rsquo; such a
      reproach is not to be feared. He speaks his own intelligible language, and
      whoever reproduces it without turning to the right or left has won, for he
      has created a work whose value every true friend of art, no matter to what
      school he belongs, prizes highly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me personally such works of living reality are cordially welcome. Yet
      art neither can nor will be satisfied with snatches of what is close at
      hand; but you are late-born, sons of a time when the two great tendencies
      of art have nearly reached the limits of what is attainable to them. You
      were everywhere confronted with completed work, and you are right when you
      refuse to sink to mere imitators of earlier works, and therefore return to
      Nature, with which we Hellenes, and perhaps the Egyptians also, began. The
      latter forgot her; the former&mdash;we Greeks&mdash;continued to cling to
      her closely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some few,&rdquo; Hermon eagerly interrupted the other, &ldquo;still think it worth
      the trouble to take from her what she alone can bestow. They save
      themselves the toilsome search for the model which others so successfully
      used before them, and bronze and marble still keep wonderfully well. Bring
      out the old masterpieces. Take the head from this one, the arm from that,
      etc. The pupil impresses the proportions on his mind. Only so far as the
      longing for the beautiful permits do even the better ones remain faithful
      to Nature, not a finger&rsquo;s breadth more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; the other went on calmly. &ldquo;But your objection only brings
      one nearer the goal. How many who care only for applause content
      themselves to-day, unfortunately, with Nature at second hand! Without
      returning to her eternally fresh, inexhaustible spring, they draw from the
      conveniently accessible wells which the great ancients dug for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know these many,&rdquo; Hermon wrathfully exclaimed. &ldquo;They are the brothers
      of the Homeric poets, who take verses from the Iliad and Odyssey to piece
      out from them their own pitiful poems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, my son!&rdquo; exclaimed Thyone, laughing, and Daphne remarked that
      the poet Cleon had surprised her father with such a poem a few weeks
      before. It was a marvellous bit of botchwork, and yet there was a certain
      meaning in the production, compiled solely from Homeric verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diomed&rsquo;s Hecuba,&rdquo; observed Proclus, &ldquo;and the Aphrodite by Hippias, which
      were executed in marble, originated in the same way, and deserve no better
      fate, although they please the great multitude. But, praised be my lord,
      Apollo, our age can also boast of other artists. Filled with the spirit of
      the god, they are able to model truthfully and faithfully even the forms
      of the immortals invisible to the physical eye. They stand before the
      spectator as if borrowed from Nature, for their creators have filled them
      with their own healthy vigour. Our poor Myrtilus belonged to this class
      and, after your Demeter, the world will include you in it also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; answered Hermon in a tone of dissent, &ldquo;I remained faithful to
      myself, and put nothing, nothing at all of my own personality, into the
      forms borrowed from Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What need of that was there?&rdquo; asked Proclus with a subtle smile. &ldquo;Your
      model spared you the task. And this at last brings me to the goal I
      desired to reach. As the great Athenians created types for eternity, so
      also does Nature at times in a happy hour, for her own pleasure, and such
      a model you found in our Daphne.-No contradiction, my dear young lady! The
      outlines of the figure&mdash;By the dog! Hermon might possibly have found
      forms no less beautiful in the Aphrosion, but how charming and lifelike is
      the somewhat unusual yet graceful pose of yours! And then the heart, the
      soul! In your companionship our artist had nothing to do except lovingly
      to share your feelings in order to have at his disposal everything which
      renders so dear to us all the giver of bread, the preserver of peace, the
      protector of marriage, the creator and supporter of the law of moderation
      in Nature, as well as in human existence. Where would all these traits be
      found more perfectly united in a single human being than in your person,
      Daphne, your quiet, kindly rule?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stop!&rdquo; the girl entreated. &ldquo;I am only too well aware&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you also are not free from human frailties,&rdquo; Proclus continued,
      undismayed. &ldquo;We will take them, great or small as they may be, into the
      bargain. The secret ones do not concern the sculptor, who does not or will
      not see them. What he perceives in you, what you enable him to recognise
      through every feature of your sweet, tranquillizing face, is enough for
      the genuine artist to imagine the goddess; for the distinction between the
      mortal and the immortal is only the degree of perfection, and the human
      intellect and artist soul can find nothing more perfect in the whole
      domain of Demeter&rsquo;s jurisdiction than is presented to them in your nature.
      Our friend yonder seized it, and his magnificent work of art proves how
      nearly it approaches the purest and loftiest conception we form of the
      goddess whom he had to represent. It is not that he deified you, Daphne;
      he merely bestowed on the divinity forms which he recognised in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment, obeying an uncontrollable impulse, Hermon pulled the
      bandage from his eyes to see once more the woman to whom this warm homage
      was paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the experienced connoisseur of art and the artist soul in the right?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had told himself the same thing when he selected Daphne for a model,
      and her head reproduced what Proclus praised as the common possession of
      Daphne and Demeter. Truthful Myrtilus had also seen it. Perhaps his work
      had really been so marvellously successful because, while he was engaged
      upon it, his friend had constantly stood before his mind in all the charm
      of her inexhaustible goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animated by the ardent desire to gaze once more at the beloved face, to
      which he now owed also this unexpectedly great success, he turned toward
      the spot whence her voice had reached him; but a wall of violet mist,
      dotted with black specks, was all that his blinded eyes showed him, and
      with a low groan he drew the linen cloth over the burns.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Proclus also perceived what was passing in the poor artist&rsquo;s
      mind, and when he took leave of him it was with the resolve to do his
      utmost to brighten with the stars of recognition and renown the dark night
      of suffering which enshrouded this highly gifted sculptor, whose
      unexpectedly great modesty had prepossessed him still more in his favour.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the grammateus had retired, Daphne insisted upon leaving Tennis the
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desire to see Hermon&rsquo;s masterpiece drew her back to Alexandria even
      more strongly than the knowledge of being missed by her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the separation from Thyone rendered the departure difficult, for the
      motherless girl had found in her something for which she had long yearned,
      and most sorely missed in her companion Chrysilla, who from expediency
      approved of everything she did or said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matron, too, had become warmly attached to Daphne, and would gladly
      have done all that lay in her power to lighten Hermon&rsquo;s sad fate, yet she
      persisted in her determination to return speedily to her old husband in
      Pelusium.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not fully realize how difficult this departure would be for
      her until the blind man, after a long silence, asked whether it was night,
      if the stars were in the sky, and if she really intended to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then burning sympathy filled her compassionate soul, and she could no
      longer restrain her tears. Daphne, too, covered her face, and imposed the
      strongest restraint upon herself that she might not sob aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it seemed a boon to both when Hermon expressed the desire to spend part
      of the night on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      This desire contained a summons to action, and to be able to bestir
      themselves in useful service appeared like a favour to Thyone and Daphne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without calling upon a slave, a female servant, or even Chrysilla for the
      smallest office, the two prepared a couch on deck for the blind man, and,
      leaning on the girl&rsquo;s stronger arm, he went up into the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he stretched both arms heavenward, inhaled deep breaths of the cool
      night breeze, and thirstily emptied the goblet of wine which Daphne mixed
      and gave him with her own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a sigh of relief, he said: &ldquo;Everything has not grown black yet.
      A delightful feeling of pleasure takes possession even of the blind man
      when the open air refreshes him and the wine warms his blood in the
      sunshine of your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And much better things are still in prospect,&rdquo; Daphne assured him. &ldquo;Just
      think what rapture it will be when you are permitted to see the light
      again after so long a period of darkness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&mdash;&rdquo; repeated Hermon, his head drooping as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must, it must be so!&rdquo; rang with confident assurance from Thyone&rsquo;s
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; added Daphne, gazing sometimes upward to the firmament strewn
      with shining stars, sometimes across the broad, rippling expanse of the
      water, in which the reflection of the heavenly bodies shimmered in
      glittering, silvery radiance, &ldquo;yes, Hermon, who would not be glad to
      exchange with you then? You may shake your head, but I would take your
      place quickly and with joyous courage. There is a proof of the existence
      of the gods, which so exactly suits the hour when you will again see,
      enjoy, admire what this dreary darkness now hides from you. It was a
      philosopher who used it; I no longer know which one. How often I have
      thought of it since this cruel misfortune befell you! And now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Hermon interrupted with a smile of superiority. &ldquo;You are thinking
      of Aristotle&rsquo;s man who grew up in a dark cave. The conditions which must
      precede the devout astonishment of the liberated youth when he first
      emerged into the light and the verdant world would certainly exist in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not in that way,&rdquo; pleaded the wounded girl; and Thyone exclaimed:
      &ldquo;What is the story of the man you mention? We don&rsquo;t talk about Aristotle
      and such subjects in Pelusium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they are only too much discussed in Alexandria,&rdquo; said the blind
      artist. &ldquo;The Stagirite, as you have just heard, seeks to prove the
      existence of the gods by the man of whom I spoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he does prove it,&rdquo; protested Daphne. &ldquo;Just listen, Mother Thyone. A
      little boy grows up from earliest childhood into a youth in a dark cave.
      Then suddenly its doors are opened to him. For the first time he sees the
      sun, moon, and stars, flowers and trees, perhaps even a beautiful human
      face. But at the moment when all these things rush upon him like so many
      incomprehensible marvels, must he not ask himself who created all this
      magnificence? And the answer which comes to him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one,&rdquo; cried the matron; &ldquo;the omnipotent gods. Do you shrug
      your shoulders at that, son of the pious Erigone? Why, of course! The
      child who still feels the blows probably rebels against his earthly
      father. But if I see aright, the resentment will not last when you, like
      the man, go out of the cave and your darkness also passes away. Then the
      power from which you turned defiantly will force itself upon you, and you
      will raise your hands in grateful prayer to the rescuing divinity. As to
      us women, we need not be drawn out of a cave to recognise it. A mother who
      reared three stalwart sons&mdash;I will say nothing of the daughters&mdash;can
      not live without them. Why are they so necessary to her? Because we love
      our children twice as much as ourselves, and the danger which threatens
      them alarms the poor mother&rsquo;s heart thrice as much as her own. Then it
      needs the helping powers. Even though they often refuse their aid, we may
      still be grateful for the expectation of relief. I have poured forth many
      prayers for the three, I assure you, and after doing so with my whole
      soul, then, my son, no matter how wildly the storm had raged within my
      breast, calmness returned, and Hope again took her place at the helm. In
      the school of the denier of the gods, you forgot the immortals above and
      depended on yourself alone. Now you need a guide, or even two or three of
      them, in order to find the way. If your mother were still alive, you would
      run back to her to hide your face in her lap. But she is dead, and if I
      were as proud as you, before clasping the sustaining hand of another
      mortal I would first try whether one would not be voluntarily extended
      from among the Olympians. If I were you, I would begin with Demeter, whom
      you honoured by so marvellous a work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon waved his hand as if brushing away a troublesome fly, exclaiming
      impatiently: &ldquo;The gods, always the gods! I know by my own mother, Thyone,
      what you women are, though I was only seven years old when I was bereft of
      her by the same powers that you call good and wise, and who have also
      robbed me of my eyesight, my friend, and all else that was dear. I thank
      you for your kind intention, and you, too, Daphne, for recalling the
      beautiful allegory. How often we have argued over its meaning! If we
      continued the discussion, perhaps it might pleasantly shorten the next few
      hours, which I dread as I do my whole future existence, but I should be
      obliged in the outset to yield the victory to you. The great Herophilus is
      right when he transfers the seat of thought from the heart to the head.
      What a wild tumult is raging here behind my brow, and how one voice drowns
      another! The medley baffles description. I could more easily count with my
      blind eyes the cells in a honeycomb than refute with my bewildered brain
      even one shrewd objection. It seems to me that we need our eyes to
      understand things. We certainly do to taste. Whatever I eat and drink&mdash;langustae
      and melons, light Mareotic wine and the dark liquor of Byblus my tongue
      can scarcely distinguish it. The leech assures me that this will pass
      away, but until the chaos within merges into endurable order there is
      nothing better for me than solitude and rest, rest, rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not deny them to you,&rdquo; replied Thyone, glancing significantly at
      Daphne. &ldquo;Proclus&rsquo;s enthusiastic judgment was sincerely meant. Begin by
      rejoicing over it in the inmost depths of your heart, and vividly
      imagining what a wealth of exquisite joys will be yours through your last
      masterpiece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly, if I can,&rdquo; replied the blind man, gratefully extending his
      hand. &ldquo;If I could only escape the doubt whether the most cruel tyrant
      could devise anything baser than to rob the artist, the very person to
      whom it is everything, of his sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is terrible,&rdquo; Daphne assented. &ldquo;Yet it seems to me that a richer
      compensation for the lost gift is at the disposal of you artists than of
      us other mortals, for you understand how to look with the eyes of the
      soul. With them you retain what you have seen, and illumine it with a
      special radiance. Homer was blind, and for that very reason, I think, the
      world and life became clear and transfigured for him though a veil
      concealed both from his physical vision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poet!&rdquo; Hermon exclaimed. &ldquo;He draws from his own soul what sight, and
      sight alone, brings to us sculptors. And, besides, his spirit remained
      free from the horrible darkness that assailed mine. Joy itself, Daphne,
      has lost its illuminating power within. What, girl, what is to become of
      the heart in which even hope was destroyed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Defend it manfully and keep up your courage,&rdquo; she answered softly; but he
      pressed her hand firmly, and, in order not to betray how self-compassion
      was melting his own soul, burst forth impetuously: &ldquo;Say rather: Crush the
      wish whose fulfilment is self-humiliation! I will go back to Alexandria.
      Even the blind and crippled can find ways to earn their bread there. Now
      grant me rest, and leave me alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thyone drew the girl away with her into the ship&rsquo;s cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after, the steward Gras went to Hermon to entreat him to
      yield to Thyone&rsquo;s entreaties and leave the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leech had directed the sufferer to protect himself from draughts and
      dampness, and the cool night mists were rising more and more densely from
      the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon doubtless felt them, but the thought of returning to the close
      cabin was unendurable. He fancied that his torturing thoughts would stifle
      him in the gloom where even fresh air was denied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He allowed the careful Bithynian to throw a coverlet over him and draw the
      hood of his cloak over his head, but his entreaties and warnings were
      futile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward&rsquo;s watchful nursing reminded Hermon of his own solicitude for
      his friend and of his faithful slave Bias, both of whom he had lost. Then
      he remembered the eulogy of the grammateus, and it brought up the question
      whether Myrtilus would have agreed with him. Like Proclus, his
      keen-sighted and honest friend had called Daphne the best model for the
      kindly goddess. He, too, had given to his statue the features of the
      daughter of Archias, and admitted that he had been less successful. But
      the figure! Perhaps he, Hermon, in his perpetual dissatisfaction with
      himself had condemned his own work too severely, but that it lacked the
      proper harmony had escaped neither Myrtilus nor himself. Now he recalled
      the whole creation to his remembrance, and its weaknesses forced
      themselves upon him so strongly and objectionably that the extravagant
      praise of the stern critic awakened fresh doubts in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet a man like the grammateus, who on the morrow or the day following it
      would be obliged to repeat his opinion before the King and the judges,
      certainly would not have allowed himself to be carried away by mere
      compassion to so great a falsification of his judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or was he himself sharing the experience of many a fellow-artist? How
      often the creator deceived himself concerning the value of his own work!
      He had expected the greatest success from his Polyphemus hurling the rock
      at Odysseus escaping in the boat, and a gigantic smith had posed for a
      model. Yet the judges had condemned it in the severest manner as a work
      far exceeding the bounds of moderation, and arousing positive dislike. The
      clay figure had not been executed in stone or metal, and crumbled away.
      The opposite would probably now happen with the Demeter. Her bending
      attitude had seemed to him daring, nay, hazardous; but the acute critic
      Proclus had perceived that it was in accord with one of Daphne&rsquo;s habits,
      and therefore numbered it among the excellences of the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the judges who awarded the prize agreed with the verdict of the
      grammateus, he must accustom himself to value his own work higher, perhaps
      even above that of Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was this possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw his friend&rsquo;s Demeter as though it was standing before him, and
      again he recognised in it the noblest masterpiece its maker had ever
      created. What praise this marvellous work would have deserved if his own
      really merited such high encomiums!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly an idea came to him, which at first he rejected as inconceivable;
      but it would not allow itself to be thrust aside, and its consideration
      made his breath fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if his own Demeter had been destroyed and Myrtilus&rsquo;s statue saved? If
      the latter was falsely believed to be his work, then Proclus&rsquo;s judgment
      was explained&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      Seized by a torturing anguish, he groaned aloud, and the steward Gras
      inquired what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon hastily grasped the Bithynian&rsquo;s arm, and asked what he knew about
      the rescue of his statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was by no means satisfying. Gras had only heard that, after
      being found uninjured in his studio, it had been dragged with great
      exertion into the open air. The goldsmith Chello had directed the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon remembered all this himself, yet, with an imperious curtness in
      marked contrast to his usual pleasant manner to this worthy servant, he
      hoarsely commanded him to bring Chello to him early the next morning, and
      then again relapsed into his solitary meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the terrible conjecture which had just entered his mind should be
      confirmed, no course remained save to extinguish the only new light which
      now illumined the darkness of his night, or to become a cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet his resolution was instantly formed. If the goldsmith corroborated his
      fear, he would publicly attribute the rescued work to the man who created
      it. And he persisted in this intention, indignantly silencing the secret
      voice which strove to shake it. It temptingly urged that Myrtilus, so rich
      in successes, needed no new garland. His lost sight would permit him,
      Hermon, from reaping fresh laurels, and his friend would so gladly bestow
      this one upon him. But he angrily closed his ears to these enticements,
      and felt it a humiliation that they dared to approach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With proud self-reliance he threw back his head, saying to himself that,
      though Myrtilus should permit him ten times over to deck him self with his
      feathers, he would reject them. He would remain himself, and was conscious
      of possessing powers which perhaps surpassed his friend&rsquo;s. He was as well
      qualified to create a genuine work of art as the best sculptor, only
      hitherto the Muse had denied him success in awakening pleasure, and
      blindness would put an end to creating anything of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more vividly he recalled to memory his own work and his friend&rsquo;s, the
      more probable appeared his disquieting supposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also saw Myrtilus&rsquo;s figure before him, and in imagination heard his
      friend again promise that, with the Arachne, he would wrest the prize even
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the terrible events of the last hours he had thought but seldom and
      briefly of the weaver, whom it had seemed a rare piece of good fortune to
      be permitted to represent. Now the remembrance of her took possession of
      his soul with fresh power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image of Arachne illumined by the lamplight, which Althea had showed
      him, appeared like worthless jugglery, and he soon drove it back into the
      darkness which surrounded him. Ledscha&rsquo;s figure, however, rose before him
      all the more radiantly. The desire to possess her had flown to the four
      winds; but he thought he had never before beheld anything more peculiar,
      more powerful, or better worth modelling than the Biamite girl as he saw
      her in the Temple of Nemesis, with uplifted hand, invoking the vengeance
      of the goddess upon him, and there&mdash;he discovered it now&mdash;Daphne
      was not at all mistaken. Images never presented themselves as distinctly
      to those who could see as to the blind man in his darkness. If he was ever
      permitted to receive his sight, what a statue of the avenging goddess he
      could create from this greatest event in the history of his vision!
    </p>
    <p>
      After this work&mdash;of that he was sure&mdash;he would no longer need
      the borrowed fame which, moreover, he rejected with honest indignation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It must be late, for Hermon felt the cool breeze, which in this region
      rose between midnight and sunrise, on his burned face and, shivering, drew
      his mantle closer round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it seemed impossible to return to the cabin; the memory of Ledscha
      imploring vengeance, and the stern image of the avenging goddess in the
      cella of the little Temple of Nemesis, completely mastered him. In the
      close cabin these terrible visions, united with the fear of having reaped
      undeserved praise, would have crouched upon his breast like harpies and
      stifled or driven him mad. After what had happened, to number the swift
      granting of the insulted Biamite&rsquo;s prayer among the freaks of chance was
      probably a more arbitrary and foolish proceeding than, with so many
      others, to recognise the incomprehensible power of Nemesis. Ledscha had
      loosed it against him and his health, perhaps even his life, and he
      imagined that she was standing before him with the bridle and wheel,
      threatening him afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shivering, as if chilled to the bone, overwhelmed by intense horror, he
      turned his blinded eyes upward to the blackness above and raised his hand,
      for the first time since he had joined the pupils of Straton in the
      Museum, to pray. He besought Nemesis to be content, and not add to
      blindness new tortures to augment the terrible ones which rent his soul,
      and he did so with all the ardour of his passionate nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward Gras had received orders to wake the Lady Thyone if anything
      unusual happened to the blind man, and when he heard the unfortunate
      artist groan so pitifully that it would have moved a stone, and saw him
      raise his hand despairingly to his head, he thought it was time to utter
      words of consolation, and a short time after the anxious matron followed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her low exclamation startled Hermon. To be disturbed in the first prayer
      after so long a time, in the midst of the cries of distress of a
      despairing soul, is scarcely endurable, and the blind man imposed little
      restraint upon himself when his old friend asked what had occurred, and
      urged him not to expose himself longer to the damp night air.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he resolutely resisted, declaring that he should lose his senses
      alone in the close cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in her cordial, simple way, she offered to bear him company in the
      cabin. She could not sleep longer, at any rate; she must leave him early
      in the morning, and they still had many things to confide to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched by so much kindness, he yielded and, leaning on the Bithynian&rsquo;s
      arm, followed her, not into his little cabin, but into the captain&rsquo;s
      spacious sitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a single lamp dimly lighted the wainscoting, composed of ebony,
      ivory, and tortoise shell, the gay rug carpet, and the giraffe and panther
      skins hung on the walls and doors and flung on the couches and the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone needed no brilliant illumination for this conversation, and the
      blinded man was ordered to avoid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matron was glad to be permitted to communicate to Hermon so speedily
      all that filled her own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he remained on deck, she had gone to Daphne&rsquo;s cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had already retired, and when Thyone went to the side of the couch she
      found the girl, with her cheeks wet with tears, still weeping, and easily
      succeeded in leading the motherless maiden to make a frank confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both cousins had been dear to her from childhood; but while Myrtilus,
      though often impeded by his pitiable sufferings, had reached by a smooth
      pathway the highest recognition, Hermon&rsquo;s impetuous toiling and striving
      had constantly compelled her to watch his course with anxious solicitude
      and, often unobserved, extend a helping hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sympathy, disapproval, and fear, which, however, was always blended with
      admiration of his transcendent powers, had merged into love. Though he had
      disdained to return it, it had nevertheless been perfectly evident that he
      needed her, and valued her and her opinion. Often as their views differed,
      the obstinate boy and youth had never allowed any one except herself a
      strong influence over his acts and conduct. But, far as he seemed to
      wander from the paths which she believed the right ones, she had always
      held fast to the conviction that he was a man of noble nature, and an
      artist who, if he only once fixed his eyes upon the true goal, would far
      surpass by his mighty power the other Alexandrian sculptors, whatever
      names they bore, and perhaps even Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the great vexation of her father who, after her mother&rsquo;s death, in an
      hour when his heart was softened, had promised that he would never impose
      any constraint upon her in the choice of a husband, she had hitherto
      rejected every suitor. She had showed even the distinguished Philotas in
      Pelusium, without the least reserve, that he was seeking her in vain; for
      just at that time she thought she had perceived that Hermon returned her
      love, and after his abrupt departure it had become perfectly evident that
      the happiness of her life depended upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible misfortune which had now befallen him had only bound her more
      firmly to the man she loved. She felt that she belonged to him
      indissolubly, and the leech&rsquo;s positive assurance that his blindness was
      incurable had only increased the magic of the thought of being and
      affording tenfold more to the man bereft of sight than when, possessing
      his vision, the world, life, and art belonged to him. To be able to lavish
      everything upon the most beloved of mortals, and do whatever her warm,
      ever-helpful heart prompted, seemed to her a special favour of the gods in
      whom she believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That it was Demeter, to the ranks of whose priestesses she belonged, who
      was so closely associated with his blinding, also seemed to her no mere
      work of chance. The goddess on whom Hermon had bestowed the features of
      her own face had deprived him of sight to confer upon her the happiness of
      brightening and beautifying the darkness of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she saw aright, and it was only the fear of obtaining, with herself,
      her wealth, that still kept him from her, the path which would finally
      unite them must be found at last. She hoped to conquer also her father&rsquo;s
      reluctance to give his only child in marriage to a blind man, especially
      as Hermon&rsquo;s last work promised to give him the right to rank with the best
      artists of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matron had listened to this confession with an agitated heart. She had
      transported herself in imagination into the soul of the girl&rsquo;s mother, and
      brought before her mind what objections the dead woman would have made to
      her daughter&rsquo;s union with a man deprived of sight; but Daphne had firmly
      insisted upon her wish, and supported it by many a sensible and surprising
      answer. She was beyond childhood, and her three-and-twenty years enabled
      her to realize the consequences which so unusual a marriage threatened to
      entail.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Thyone herself, she was always disposed to look on the bright side,
      and the thought that this vigorous young man, this artist crowned with the
      highest success, must remain in darkness to the end of his life, was
      utterly incompatible with her belief in the goodness of the gods. But if
      Hermon was cured, a rare wealth of the greatest happiness awaited him in
      the union with Daphne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mood in which she found the blind man had wounded and troubled her.
      Now she renewed the bandage, saying: &ldquo;How gladly I would continue to use
      my old hands for you, but this will be the last time in a long while that
      I am permitted to do this for the son of my Erigone; I must leave you
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon clasped her hand closely, exclaiming with affectionate warmth: &ldquo;You
      must not go, Thyone! Stay here, even if it is only a few days longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What pleasure these words gave her, and how gladly she would have
      fulfilled his wish! But it could not be, and he did not venture to detain
      her by fresh entreaties after she had described how her aged husband was
      suffering from her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I often ask myself what he still finds in me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;True, so long a
      period of wedded life is a firm tie. If I am gone and he does not find me
      when he returns home from inspections, he wanders about as if lost, and
      does not even relish his food, though the same cook has prepared it for
      years. And he, who forgets nothing and knows by name a large number of the
      many thousand men he commands, would very probably, when I am away, join
      the troops with only sandals on his feet. To miss my ugly old face really
      can not be so difficult! When he wooed me, of course I looked very
      different. And so&mdash;he confessed it himself&mdash;so he always sees
      me, and most plainly when I am absent from his sight. But that, Hermon,
      will be your good fortune also. All you now know as young and beautiful
      will continue so to you as long as this sorrowful blindness lasts, and on
      that very account you must not remain alone, my boy&mdash;that is, if your
      heart has already decided in favour of any one&mdash;and that is the case,
      unless these old eyes deceive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daphne,&rdquo; he answered dejectedly, &ldquo;why should I deny that she is dear to
      me? And yet, how dare the blind man take upon himself the sin of binding
      her young life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; Thyone interrupted with eager warmth. &ldquo;She loves you, and to
      be everything to you is the greatest happiness she can imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until repentance awakes, and it is too late,&rdquo; he answered gravely. &ldquo;But
      even were her love strong enough to share her husband&rsquo;s misfortune
      patiently&mdash;nay, perhaps with joyous courage&mdash;it would still be
      contemptible baseness were I to profit by that love and seek her hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hermon!&rdquo; the matron now exclaimed reproachfully; but he repeated with
      strong emphasis: &ldquo;Yes, it would be baseness so great that even her most
      ardent love could not save me from the reproach of having committed it. I
      will not speak of her father, to whom I am so greatly indebted. It may be
      that it might satisfy Daphne, full of kindness as she is, to devote
      herself, body and soul, to the service of her helpless companion. But I?
      Far from thinking constantly, like her, solely of others and their
      welfare, I should only too often, selfish as I now am, be mindful of
      myself. But when I realize who I am, I see before me a blind man who is
      poorer than a beggar, because the scorching flames melted even the gold
      which was to help him pay his debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folly!&rdquo; cried the matron. &ldquo;For what did Archias gather his boundless
      treasures? And when his daughter is once yours&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Hermon went on bitterly, &ldquo;the blinded artist&rsquo;s poverty will be
      over. That is your opinion, and the majority of people will share it. But
      I have my peculiarities, and the thought of being rescued from hunger and
      thirst by the woman I love, and who ought to see in me the man from whom
      she receives the best gifts&mdash;to be dependent on her as the recipient
      of her alms&mdash;seems to me worse than if I were once more to lose my
      sight. I could not endure it at all! Every mouthful would choke me. Just
      because she is so dear to me, I can not seek her hand; for, in return for
      her great self-sacrificing love, I could give her nothing save the keen
      discontent which seizes the proud soul that is forced constantly to accept
      benefits, as surely as the ringing sound follows the blow upon the brass.
      My whole future life would become a chain of humiliations, and do you know
      whither this unfortunate marriage would lead? My teacher Straton once said
      that a man learns to hate no one more easily than the person from whom he
      receives benefits which it is out of his power to repay. That is wise, and
      before I will see my great love for Daphne transformed to hate, I will
      again try the starving which, while I was a sculptor at Rhodes, I learned
      tolerably well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But would not a great love,&rdquo; asked Thyone, &ldquo;suffice to repay tenfold the
      perishable gifts that can be bought with gold and silver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and again no!&rdquo; Hermon answered in an agitated tone. &ldquo;Something else
      would blend with the love I brought to the marriage, something that must
      destroy all the compensation it might offer; for I see myself becoming a
      resentful misanthrope if I am compelled to relinquish the pleasure of
      creating and, condemned to dull inaction, can do nothing except allow
      myself to be tended, drink, eat, and sleep. The gloomy mood of her
      unfortunate husband would sadden Daphne&rsquo;s existence even more than my own;
      for, Thyone, though I should strive with all my strength to bear
      patiently, with her dear aid, the burden imposed upon me, and move on
      through the darkness with joyous courage, like many another blind man, I
      could not succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man,&rdquo; the matron exclaimed indignantly, &ldquo;and what thousands
      have done before you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he loudly protested, &ldquo;I should surely fail; for, you dear woman,
      who mean so kindly by me, my fate is worse than theirs. Do you know what
      just forced from my lips the exclamation of pain which alarmed you? I, the
      only child of the devout Erigone, for whose sake you are so well disposed
      toward me, am doomed to misfortune as surely as the victim dragged to the
      altar is certain of death. Of all the goddesses, there is only one in
      whose power I believe, and to whom I just raised my hands in prayer. It is
      the terrible one to whom I was delivered by hate and the deceived love
      which is now dragging me by the hair, and will rob and torture me till I
      despair of life. I mean the gray daughter of Night, whom no one escapes,
      dread Nemesis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thyone sank down into the chair by the blind artist&rsquo;s side, asking softly,
      &ldquo;And what gave you into her avenging hands, hapless boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own abominable folly,&rdquo; he answered mournfully and, with the feeling
      that it would relieve his heart to pour out to this true friend what he
      would usually have confided only to his Myrtilus, he hurriedly related how
      he had recognised in Ledscha the best model for his Arachne, how he had
      sought her love, and then, detained by Althea, left her in the lurch and
      most deeply offended and insulted her. Lastly, he gave a brief but vivid
      description of his meeting with the vengeful barbarian girl in the Temple
      of Nemesis, how Ledscha had invoked upon him the wrath of the terrible
      goddess, and how the most horrible punishment had fallen upon him directly
      after the harsh accusation of the Biamite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matron had listened to this confession in breathless suspense. Now she
      fixed her eyes on the floor, shook her gray head gently, and said
      anxiously: &ldquo;Is that it? It certainly puts things in a different light. As
      the son of your never-to-be-forgotten mother, you are indeed dear to my
      heart; but Daphne is not less dear to me, and though in your marriage I
      just saw happiness for you both, that is now past. What is poverty, what
      is blindness! Eros would reconcile far more difficult problems, but his
      arrows are shattered on the armour of Nemesis. Where there is a pair of
      lovers, and she raises her scourge against one of them, the other will
      also be struck. Until you feel that you are freed from this persecutor, it
      would be criminal to bind a loving woman to you and your destiny. It is
      not easy to find the right path for you both, for even Nemesis and her
      power do not make the slightest change in the fact that you need faithful
      care and watching in your blindness. Daylight brings wisdom, and we will
      talk further to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose as she spoke; but Hermon detained her, while from his lips
      escaped the anxious question, &ldquo;So you will take Daphne away from me, and
      leave me alone in my blindness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You in your blindness?&rdquo; cried Thyone, and the mere reproachful tone of
      the question banished the fear. &ldquo;I would as quickly deprive my own son of
      my support as I would you just at this time, my poor boy; but whether my
      conscience will permit me to let Daphne remain near you only grant me, I
      repeat it, until sunrise to-morrow for reflection. My old heart will then
      find the right way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet whatever you may decide concerning us,&rdquo; pleaded the blind man, &ldquo;tell
      Daphne that, on the eve of losing her, I first felt in its full power how
      warmly I love her. Even without Nemesis, the joy of making her mine would
      have been denied me. Fate will never permit me to possess her; yet never
      again to hear her gentle voice, never more to feel her dear presence,
      would be blinding me a second time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It need not be imposed upon you long,&rdquo; said the matron soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went close to him, laid her hand on his shoulder, and said: &ldquo;The
      power of the goddess who punishes the misdeeds of the reckless is called
      irresistible and uncontrollable; but one thing softens even her, and
      checks her usually resistless wheel: it is a mother&rsquo;s prayer. I heard this
      from my own mother, and experienced it myself, especially in my oldest son
      Eumedes, who from the wildest madcap became an ornament of his class, and
      to whom the King&mdash;you doubtless know it&mdash;intrusted the command
      of the fleet which is to open the Ethiopian land of elephants to the
      Egyptian power. You, Hermon, are an orphan, but for you, too, the souls of
      your parents live on. Only I do not know whether you still honour and pray
      to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did until a few years ago,&rdquo; replied Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But later you neglected this sacred duty,&rdquo; added Thyone. &ldquo;Yet how was
      that possible? In our barren Pelusium I could not help thinking hundreds
      of times of the grove which Archias planted in your necropolis for the
      dead members of his family, and how often, while we were in Alexandria, it
      attracted me to think in its shade of your never-to-be-forgotten mother.
      There I felt her soul near me; for there was her home, and in imagination
      I saw her walking and resting under the trees. And you&mdash;her beloved
      child&mdash;you remained aloof from this hallowed spot! Even at the
      festival of the dead you omitted prayers and sacrifices?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blind artist assented to this question by a silent bend of the head;
      but the matron indignantly exclaimed: &ldquo;And did not you know, unhappy man,
      that you were thus casting away the shield which protects mortals from the
      avenging gods? And your glorious mother, who would have given her life for
      you? Yet you loved her, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thyone!&rdquo; Hermon cried, deeply wounded, holding out his right hand as if
      in defence. &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the matron. &ldquo;I know that you revere her
      memory. But that alone is not sufficient. On memorial festivals, and
      especially on the birthdays, a mother&rsquo;s soul needs a prayer and a gift
      from the son, a wreath, a fillet, fragrant ointment, a piece of honey, a
      cup of wine or milk&mdash;all these things even the poor man spares from
      his penury&mdash;yet a warm prayer, in pure remembrance and love, would
      suffice to rob the wrath of Nemesis, which the enraged barbarian girl let
      loose upon you, of its power. Only your mother, Hermon, the soul of the
      noble woman who bore you, can restore to you what you have lost. Appeal
      for aid to her, son of Erigone, and she will yet make everything right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bending quickly over the artist as she spoke, she kissed his brow and
      moved steadily away, though he called her name with yearning entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after, the steward Gras led Hermon to his cabin, and while
      undressing him reported that a messenger from Pelusium had announced that
      the commandant Philippus was coming to Tennis the next morning, before the
      market place filled, to take his wife with him to Alexandria, where he was
      going by the King&rsquo;s command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon only half listened, and then ordered the Bithynian to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had reclined on the couch a short time, he softly called the
      names of the steward, Thyone, and Daphne. As he received no answer, and
      thus learned that he was alone, he rose, drew himself up to his full
      height, gazed heavenward with his bandaged eyes, stretched both hands
      toward the ceiling of the low cabin, and obeyed his friend&rsquo;s bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly convinced that he was doing right, and ashamed of having so
      long neglected what the duty of a son commanded, he implored his mother&rsquo;s
      soul for forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      While doing so he again found that the figure which he recalled to his
      memory appeared before him with marvellous distinctness. Never had she
      been so near him since, when a boy of seven, she clasped him for the last
      time to her heart. She tenderly held out her arms to him, and he rushed
      into her embrace, shouting exultantly while she hugged and kissed him.
      Every pet name which he had once been so glad to hear, and during recent
      years had forgotten, again fell from her lips. As had often happened in
      days long past, he again saw his mother crown him for a festival. Pleased
      with the little new garment which she herself had woven for him and
      embroidered with a tiny tree with red apples, beneath which stood a
      bright-plumaged duckling, she led him by the hand in the necropolis to the
      empty tomb dedicated to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a building the height of a man, constructed of red Cyprian marble,
      on which, cast in bronze, shield, sword, and lance, as well as a beautiful
      helmet, lay beside a sleeping lion. It was dedicated to the memory of the
      brave hipparch whom he had been permitted to call his father, and who had
      been burned beside the battlefield on which he had found a hero&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon now again beheld himself, with his mother, garlanding, anointing,
      and twining with fresh fillets the mausoleum erected by his uncle Archias
      to his brave brother. The species of every flower, the colour of the
      fillets-nay, even the designs embroidered on his little holiday robe&mdash;again
      returned to his mind, and, while these pleasant memories hovered around
      him, he appealed to his mother in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood before him, young and beautiful, listening without reproach or
      censure as he besought her forgiveness and confided to her his sins, and
      how severely he was punished by Nemesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this confession he felt as though he was kneeling before the
      beloved dead, hiding his face in her lap, while she bent over him and
      stroked his thick, black hair. True, he did not hear her speak; but when
      he looked up again he could see, by the expression of her faithful blue
      eyes, that his manly appearance surprised her, and that she rejoiced in
      his return to her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened compassionately to his laments, and when he paused pressed
      his head to her bosom and gazed into his face with such joyous confidence
      that his heart swelled, and he told himself that she could not look at him
      thus unless she saw happiness in store for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, he began also to confide that he loved no woman on earth more
      ardently than the very Daphne whom, when only a pretty little child, she
      had carried in her arms, yet that he could not seek the wealthy heiress
      because manly pride forbade this to the blind beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the anguish of renunciation seized him with great violence, and when
      he wished to appeal again to his mother his exhausted imagination refused
      its service, and the vision would not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he groped his way back to the bed, and, as he let his head sink upon
      the pillows, he fancied that he would soon be again enwrapped in the sweet
      slumber of childhood, which had long shunned his couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was years since he had felt so full of peace and hope, and he told
      himself, with grateful joy, that every childlike emotion had not yet died
      within him, that the stern conflicts and struggles of the last years had
      not yet steeled every gentle emotion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sun of the following day had long passed its meridian when Hermon at
      last woke. The steward Gras, who had grown gray in the service of Archias,
      was standing beside the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in the round, beardless face of this well-fed yet active
      man that could have attracted the artist, yet the quiet tones of his deep
      voice recalled to memory the clear, steadfast gaze of his gray eyes, from
      which so often, in former days, inviolable fidelity, sound sense, caution,
      and prudence had looked forth at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the blind man heard from Gras surprised him&mdash;nay, at first
      seemed impossible. To sleep until the afternoon was something
      unprecedented for his wakeful temperament; but what was he to say to the
      tidings that the commandant of Pelusium had arrived in his state galley
      early in the morning and taken his wife, Daphne, and Chrysilla away with
      him to Alexandria?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it sounded credible enough when the Bithynian further informed him
      that the ladies had left messages of remembrance for him, and said that
      Archias&rsquo;s ship, upon which he was, would be at his disposal for any length
      of time he might desire. Gras was commissioned to attend him. The Lady
      Thyone especially desired him to heed her counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the steward was communicating this startling news as calmly as if
      everything was a matter of course, the events of the preceding night came
      back to Hermon&rsquo;s memory with perfect distinctness, and again the fear
      assailed him that the rescued Demeter was the work of Myrtilus, and not
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the first question he addressed to Gras concerned the Tennis goldsmith,
      and it was a keen disappointment to Hermon when he learned that the
      earliest time he could expect to see him would be the following day. The
      skilful artisan had been engaged for weeks upon the gold ornaments on the
      new doors of the holy of holies in the Temple of Amon at Tanis. Urgent
      business had called him home from the neighbouring city just before the
      night of the attack; but yesterday evening he had returned to Tanis, where
      his wife said he would have only two days&rsquo; work to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer, however, by no means appeased Hermon&rsquo;s impatience. He
      commanded that a special messenger should be sent to summon the goldsmith,
      and the Bithynian received the order with a slight shake of his round
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      What new trouble had befallen the usually alert young artist that he
      received this unexpected change in his situation as apathetically as a
      horse which is led from one stall to another, and, instead of questioning
      him, thought only of hastening his interview with the goldsmith? If his
      mistress, who had left him full of anxiety from the fear that her
      departure would deeply agitate the blind man, should learn how
      indifferently he had received it! He, Gras, certainly would not betray it.
      Eternal gods&mdash;these artists! He knew them. Their work was dearer to
      their hearts than their own lives, love, or friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      During breakfast, of which the steward was obliged to remind him, Hermon
      pondered over his fate; but how could he attain any degree of clearness of
      vision until he secured accurate information concerning the statue of
      Demeter? Like a dark cloud, which sweeps over the starry sky and prevents
      the astronomer from seeing the planets which he desires to observe, the
      fear that Proclus&rsquo;s praise had been bestowed upon the work of Myrtilus
      stood between him and every goal of his thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the fact that he still remained blind, and not even the faintest
      glimmer of light pierced the surrounding darkness, while the sun continued
      its course with glowing radiance, and that, blinded and beggared, he must
      despise himself if he sought to win Daphne, was certain. No reflection
      could alter it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the peace of mind which he thought he had regained during slumber
      was destroyed. Fear of the artisan&rsquo;s statement even rendered it impossible
      to pray to his mother with the affectionate devotion he had felt the day
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goldsmith had directed the rescue of the Demeter, yet he would
      scarcely have been able to distinguish it from the statue by Myrtilus; for
      though, like his friend, he had often employed his skilful hands in the
      arrangement of the gold plates at the commencement of the work, the
      Egyptian had been summoned to Tennis before the statues had attained
      recognisable form. He had not entered the studios for several months,
      unless Bias had granted him admittance without informing his master. This
      was quite possible, for the slave&rsquo;s keen eyes certainly had not failed to
      notice how little he and Myrtilus valued the opinion of the honest,
      skilful, but extremely practical and unimaginative man, who could not
      create independently even the smallest detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was impossible to determine at present whether Chello had seen the
      finished statues or not, yet Hermon desired the former with actual
      fervour, that he might have positive certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      While reflecting over these matters, the image of the lean Egyptian
      goldsmith, with his narrow, brown, smooth-shaven face and skull, prominent
      cheek bones, receding brow, projecting ears and, with all its keenness,
      lustreless glance, rose before him as if he could see his bodily presence.
      Not a single word unconnected with his trade, the weather, or an accident,
      had ever reached the friends&rsquo; ears from Chello&rsquo;s thick lips, and this
      circumstance seemed to warrant Hermon in the expectation of learning from
      him the pure, unadulterated truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rarely had a messenger of love been awaited with such feverish suspense as
      the slave whom Gras had despatched to Tanis to induce the goldsmith to
      return home. He might come soon after nightfall, and Hermon used the
      interval to ask the Bithynian the questions which he had long expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The replies afforded little additional information. He learned only that
      Philippus had been summoned to Alexandria by the King, and that the Lady
      Thyone and her husband had talked with the leech and assented to his
      opinion that it would be better for Hermon to wait here until the burns on
      his face were healed before returning to Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Daphne&rsquo;s sake this decision had undoubtedly been welcome to the
      matron, and it pleased him also; for he still felt so ill physically, and
      so agitated mentally, that he shrank from meeting his numerous
      acquaintances in the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goldsmith! the goldsmith! It depended upon his decision whether he
      would return to Alexandria at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after Hermon had learned from Gras that the stars had risen, he was
      informed that he must wait patiently for his interview with the Egyptian,
      as he had been summoned to the capital that very day by a messenger from
      Proclus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the steward had fresh cause to marvel at his charge, for this news
      aroused the most vehement excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, it afforded the prospect of a series&mdash;perhaps a long one&mdash;of
      the most torturing days and nights. And the dreaded hours actually came&mdash;nay,
      the anguish of uncertainty had become almost unendurable, when, on the
      seventh day, the Egyptian at last returned from Alexandria. They had
      seemed like weeks to Hermon, had made his face thinner, and mingled the
      first silver hairs in his black beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calls of the cheerful notary and the daily visits of the leech, an
      elderly man, who had depressed rather than cheered him by informing him of
      many cases like his own which all proved incurable, had been his sole
      diversion. True, the heads of the Greek residents of Tennis had also
      sometimes sought him: the higher government officials, the lessees of the
      oil monopoly and the royal bank, as well as Gorgias, who, next to Archias
      the Alexandrian, owned the largest weaving establishments, but the tales
      of daily incidents with which they entertained Hermon wearied him. He
      listened with interest only to the story of Ledscha&rsquo;s disappearance, yet
      he perceived, from the very slight impression it made upon him, how little
      he had really cared for the Biamite girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      His inquiries about Gula called down upon him many well-meant jests. She
      was with her parents; while Taus, Ledscha&rsquo;s young sister, was staying at
      the brick-kiln, where the former had reduced the unruly slaves to
      submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Care had been taken to provide for his personal safety, for the attack
      might perhaps yet prove to have been connected with the jealousy of the
      Biamite husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commandant of Pelusium had therefore placed a small garrison of
      heavily armed soldiers and archers in Tennis, for whom tents had been
      pitched on the site of the burned white house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Words of command and signals for changing the guards often reached Hermon
      when he was on the deck of his ship, and visitors praised the wise caution
      and prompt action of Alexander the Great&rsquo;s old comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notary, a vivacious man of fifty, who had lived a long time in
      Alexandria and, asserting that he grew dull and withered in little Tennis,
      went to the capital as frequently as possible, had often called upon the
      sculptor at first, and been disposed to discuss art and the other subjects
      dear to Hermon&rsquo;s heart, but on the third day he again set off for his
      beloved Alexandria. When saying farewell, he had been unusually merry, and
      asked Hermon to send him away with good wishes and offer sacrifices for
      the success of his business, since he hoped to bring a valuable gift on
      his return from the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blind artist was glad to have other visits for a short time, but he
      preferred to be alone and devote his thoughts to his own affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now knew that his love was genuine. Daphne seemed the very incarnation
      of desirable, artless, heart-refreshing womanliness, but his memory could
      not dwell with her long; anxiety concerning Chello&rsquo;s report only too
      quickly interrupted it, as soon as he yielded to its charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not think at all of the future. What was he to appoint for a time
      which the words of a third person might render unendurable?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gras at last ushered in the goldsmith, his heart throbbed so
      violently that it was difficult for him to find the words needed for the
      questions he desired to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptian had really been summoned to Alexandria by Proclus, not on
      account of the Demeter, but the clasp said to belong to Myrtilus, found
      amid the ruins of the fallen house, and he had been able to identify it
      with absolute positiveness as the sculptor&rsquo;s property.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been referred from one office to another, until finally the Tennis
      notary and Proclus opened the right doors to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the importance of his testimony appeared, since the will of the
      wealthy young sculptor could not be opened until his death was proved, and
      the clasp which had been found aided in doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon&rsquo;s question whether he had heard any particulars about this will was
      answered by the cold-hearted, dull-brained man in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had done enough, he said, by expressing his opinion. He had gone to
      Alexandria unwillingly, and would certainly have stayed in Tennis if he
      could have foreseen what a number of tiresome examinations he would be
      obliged to undergo. He had been burning with impatience to quit the place,
      on account of the important work left behind in Tanis, and he did not even
      know whether he would be reimbursed for his travelling expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this preliminary conversation Hermon gained the composure he
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by ascertaining whether Chello remembered the interior
      arrangement of the burned white house, and it soon appeared that he
      recollected it accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the blind man requested him to tell how the rescue of the statue had
      been managed, and the account of the extremely prosaic artisan described
      so clearly and practically how, on entering the burning building, he found
      Myrtilus&rsquo;s studio already inaccessible, but the statue of Demeter in
      Hermon&rsquo;s still uninjured, that the trustworthiness of his story could not
      be doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      One circumstance only appeared strange, yet it was easily explained.
      Instead of standing on the pedestal, the Demeter was beside it, and even
      the slow-witted goldsmith inferred from this fact that the robbers had
      intended to steal it and placed it on the floor for that purpose, but were
      prevented from accomplishing their design by the interference of Hermon
      and the people from Tennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Egyptian, in reply to the artist&rsquo;s inquiry concerning what other
      works of art and implements he had seen in the studio, had answered that
      nothing else could be distinguished on account of the smoke, he
      congratulated the sculptor on his last work. People were already making a
      great stir about the new Demeter. It had been discussed not only in the
      workshop of his brother, who, like himself, followed their father&rsquo;s
      calling, but also in the offices, at the harbour, in the barbers&rsquo; rooms
      and the cookshops, and he, too, must admit that, for a Greek goddess, that
      always lacked genuine, earnest dignity, it really was a pretty bit of
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, the Egyptian asked to whom he should apply for payment for the
      remainder of his labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strip of gold, from which Hermon had ordered the diadem to be made,
      had attracted his attention on the head of his Demeter, and compensation
      for the work upon this ornament was still due.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon, deeply agitated, asked, with glowing cheeks, whether Chello really
      positively remembered having prepared for him the gold diadem which he had
      seen in Alexandria, and the Egyptian eagerly assured him that he had done
      so. Hitherto he had found the sculptors honest men, and Hermon would not
      withhold the payment for his well-earned toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist strenuously denied such an intention; but when, in his desire
      to have the most absolute assurance, he again asked questions about the
      diadem, the Egyptian thought that the blind sculptor doubted the justice
      of his demand, and wrathfully insisted upon his claim, until Gras managed
      to whisper, undetected by Hermon, that he would have the money ready for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This satisfied the angry man. He honestly believed that he had prepared
      the gold for the ornament on the head of the Demeter in Alexandria; yet
      the statue chiselled by Myrtilus had also been adorned with a diadem, and
      Chello had wrought the strip of gold it required. Only it had escaped his
      memory, because he had been paid for the work immediately after its
      delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glad to obey his mistress&rsquo;s orders to settle at once any debts which the
      artist might have in Tennis, the steward followed the goldsmith while
      Hermon, seizing the huge goblet which had just been filled with wine and
      water for him drained it at one long draught. Then, with sigh of relief,
      he restored it to its place, raised his hand and his blinded eyes
      heavenward, and offered a brief, fervent thanksgiving to his mother&rsquo;s soul
      and the great Demeter, whom, he might now believe it himself, he had
      honoured with a masterpiece which had extorted warm admiration even from a
      connoisseur unfriendly his art.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gras returned, he said, with a grin of satisfaction, that the
      goldsmith was like all the rest of his countrymen. The artists did not owe
      him another drachm; the never-to-be-forgotten Myrtilus had paid for the
      work ordered by Hermon also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time since he had been led on board the ship, a gay
      laugh rang fro the blind man&rsquo;s lips, rising in deep, pure, joyous tones
      from his relieved breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faithful gray eyes of honest Gras glittered with tears at the musical
      tones, and how ardently he wished for his beloved mistress when the
      sculptor, not content with this, exclaimed as gleefully as in happier
      days: &ldquo;Hitherto I have had no real pleasure from my successful work, old
      Gras, but it is awaking now! If my Myrtilus were still alive, and these
      miserable eyes yet possessed the power of rejoicing in the light and in
      beautiful human forms, by the dog! I would have the mixing vessels filled,
      wreath after wreath brought, boon companions summoned, and with
      flute-playing, songs, and fiery words, offer the Muses, Demeter, and
      Dionysus their due meed of homage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gras declared that this wish might easily be fulfilled. There was no lack
      of wine or drinking cups on the vessel, the flute-players whom he had
      heard in the Odeum at Tanis did not understand their business amiss,
      flowers and wreaths could be obtained, and all who spoke Greek in Tennis
      would accept his invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Bithynian soon regretted this proposal, for it fell like a
      hoar-frost upon the blind man&rsquo;s happy mood. He curtly declined. He would
      not play host where he was himself a guest, and pride forbade him to use
      the property of others as though it were his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not regain his suddenly awakened pleasure in existence before
      Gras warned him it was time to go to rest. Not until he was alone in the
      quiet cabin did the sense of joy in his first great success overpower him
      afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might well feel proud delight in the work which he had created, for he
      had accomplished it without being unfaithful to the aims he had set before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been taken from his own studio, and the skilful old artisan had
      recognised his preliminary work upon the diadem which he, Hermon, had
      afterward adorned with ornaments himself. But, alas! this first must at
      the same time be his last great success, and he was condemned to live on
      in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although abundant recognition awaited him in Alexandria, his quickly
      gained renown would soon be forgotten, and he would remain a beggared
      blind man. But it was now allowable for him to think secretly of
      possessing Daphne; perhaps she would wait for him and reject other suitors
      until he learned in the capital whether he might not hope to recover his
      lost sight. He was at least secure against external want; the generous
      Archias would hardly withhold from him the prize he had intended for the
      successful statue, although the second had been destroyed. The great
      merchant would do everything for his fame-crowned nephew, and he, Hermon,
      was conscious that had his uncle been in his situation he would have
      divided his last obol with him. Refusal of his assistance would have been
      an insult to his paternal friend and guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, he might hope that Archias would take him to the most skilful
      leeches in Alexandria and, if they succeeded in restoring his lost power
      of vision, then&mdash;then Yet it seemed so presumptuous to lull himself
      in this hope that he forbade himself the pleasure of indulging it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid these consoling reflections, Hermon fell asleep, and awoke fresher
      and more cheerful than he had been for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to spend two whole weeks more in Tennis, for the burns healed
      slowly, and an anxious fear kept him away from Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the woman he loved would again meet him and, though he could assure
      Thyone that Nemesis had turned her wheel away from him, he would have been
      permitted to treat Daphne only with cool reserve, while every fibre of his
      being urged him to confess his love and clasp her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gras had already written twice to his master, telling him with what
      gratifying patience Hermon was beginning to submit to his great
      misfortune, when the notary Melampus returned from Alexandria with news
      which produced the most delightful transformation in the blind artist&rsquo;s
      outer life.
    </p>
    <p>
      More swiftly than his great corpulence usually permitted the jovial man to
      move, he ascended to the deck, calling: &ldquo;Great, greater, the greatest of
      news I bring, as the heaviest but by no means the most dilatory of
      messengers of good fortune from the city of cities. Prick up your ears, my
      friend, and summon all your strength, for there are instances of the fatal
      effect of especially lavish gifts from the blind and yet often sure aim of
      the goddess of Fortune. The Demeter, in whom you proved so marvellously
      that the art of a mortal is sufficient to create immortals, is beginning
      to show her gratitude. She is helping to twine wreaths for you in
      Alexandria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the vivacious man suddenly hesitated and, while wiping his plump
      cheeks, perspiring brow, and smooth, fat double chin with his kerchief,
      added in a tone of sincere regret: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with me! In one thing
      which really moves me, I always forget the other. The fault sticks to me
      like my ears and nose. When my mother gave me two errands, I attended to
      the first in the best possible way, but overlooked the second entirely,
      and was paid for it with my father&rsquo;s staff, yet even the blue wales made
      no change in the fault. But for that I should still be in the city of
      cities; but it robbed me of my best clients, and so I was transferred to
      this dullest of holes. Even here it clings to me. My detestable exultation
      just now proves it. Yet I know how dear to you was the dead man who
      manifests his love even from the grave. But you will forgive me the false
      note into which my weakness led me; it sprang from regard for you, my
      young friend. To serve your cause, I forgot everything else. Like my
      mother&rsquo;s first errand, it was performed in the best possible way. You will
      learn directly. By the lightnings of Father Zeus and the owl of Athene,
      the news I bring is certainly great and beautiful; but he who yearned to
      make you happy was snatched from you and, though his noble legacy must
      inspire pleasure and gratitude, it will nevertheless fill your poor eyes
      with sorrowful tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melampus turned, as he spoke, to the misshapen Egyptian slave who
      performed the duties of a clerk, and took several rolls from the
      drumshaped case that hung around his neck; but his prediction concerning
      Hermon was speedily fulfilled, for the notary handed him the will of his
      friend Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made him the heir of his entire fortune and, however happy the
      unexpected royal gift rendered the blind man, however cheering might be
      the prospects it opened to him for the future and the desire of his heart,
      sobs nevertheless interrupted the affectionate words which commenced the
      document Melampus read aloud to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless the tears which Hermon dedicated to the most beloved of human
      beings made his blinded eyes smart, but he could not restrain them, and
      even long after the notary had left him, and the steward had congratulated
      him on his good fortune, the deep emotion of his tender heart again and
      again called forth a fresh flood of tears consecrated to the memory of his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notary had already informed the grammateus of the disposition which
      Myrtilus had made of his property in Hermon&rsquo;s favour a few days before,
      but, by the advice of the experienced Proclus, the contents of the will
      had been withheld from the sculptor; the unfortunate man ought to be
      spared any disappointment, and proof that Myrtilus was really among the
      victims of the accident must first be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clasp found in the ruins of the white house appeared to furnish this,
      and the notary had put all other business aside and gone to Alexandria to
      settle the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goldsmith Chello, who had fastened a new pin to the clasp, and could
      swear that it had belonged to Myrtilus, had been summoned to the capital
      as a witness, and, with the aid of the influential grammateus of the
      Dionysian games and priest of Apollo, the zeal of Melampus had
      accomplished in a short time the settlement of this difficult affair,
      which otherwise might perhaps have consumed several months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The violent death of Myrtilus had been admitted as proved by the
      magistrate, who had been prepossessed in Hermon&rsquo;s favour by his
      masterpiece. Besides, no doubts could be raised concerning the validity of
      a will attested by sixteen witnesses. The execution of this last testament
      had been intrusted to Archias, as Myrtilus&rsquo;s nearest relative, and several
      other distinguished Alexandrians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amount of the fortune bequeathed had surprised even these wealthy men,
      for under the prudent management of Archias the property inherited by the
      modest young sculptor had trebled in value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor blind artist had suddenly become a man who might be termed
      &ldquo;rich,&rdquo; even in the great capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the steward shook his head; this vast, unexpected inheritance did
      not seem to make half so deep an impression upon the eccentric blind man
      as the news received a short time ago that his trivial debt to the
      goldsmith Chello was already settled. But Hermon must have dearly loved
      the friend to whom he owed this great change of fortune, and grief for him
      had cast joy in his immense new wealth completely into the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conjecture was confirmed on the following morning, for the blind man
      had himself led to the Greek necropolis to offer sacrifices to the gods of
      the nether world and to think of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, soon after noon, the lessee of the royal bank appeared on the ship
      to offer him as many drachmae or talents as he might need for present use,
      he asked for a considerable sum to purchase a larger death-offering for
      his murdered friend. The next morning he went with the architect of the
      province to the scene of the conflagration, and had him mark the spot of
      ground on which he desired to erect to his Myrtilus a monument to be made
      in Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunset, leaning on the steward&rsquo;s arm, he went to the Temple of Nemesis,
      where he prayed and commissioned the priest to offer a costly sacrifice to
      the goddess in his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the return home, Hermon suddenly stood still and mentioned to Gras the
      sum which he intended to bestow upon the blind in Tennis. He knew now what
      it means to live bereft of light, and, he added in a low tone, to be also
      poor and unable to earn his daily bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the ship he asked the Bithynian whether his burned face had become
      presentable again, and no longer made a repulsive impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Gras could truthfully assure him. Then the artist&rsquo;s features
      brightened, and the Bithynian heard genuine cheerfulness ring in the tones
      of his voice as he exclaimed: &ldquo;Then, old Gras, we will set out for
      Alexandria as soon as the ship is ready to sail. Back to life, to the
      society of men of my own stamp, to reap the praise earned by my own
      creations, and to the only divine maiden among mortals&mdash;to Daphne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day after to-morrow!&rdquo; exclaimed the steward in joyous excitement; and
      soon after the carrier dove was flying toward the house of Archias,
      bearing the letter which stated the hour when his fame-crowned blind
      nephew would enter the great harbour of Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of the next day but one the Proserpina was bearing Hermon away
      from the city of weavers toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the evening breeze fanned his brow, his thoughts dwelt sadly on his
      Myrtilus. Hitherto it had always seemed as if he was bound, and must
      commit some atrocious deed to use the seething power condemned to
      inaction. But as the galley left the Tanitic branch of the Nile behind,
      and the blind man inhaled the cool air upon the calm sea, his heart
      swelled, and for the first time he became fully aware that, though the
      light of the sun would probably never shine for him again, and therefore
      the joy of creating, the rapture of once more testing his fettered
      strength, would probably be forever denied him, other stars might perhaps
      illumine his path, and he was going, in a position of brilliant
      independence, toward his native city, fame, and&mdash;eternal gods!&mdash;love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne had conquered, and he gave only a passing thought to Ledscha and
      the hapless weaver Arachne.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the third hour after sunrise a distinguished assemblage of people
      gathered at the landing place east of the Temple of Poseidon in the great
      harbour of Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its members belonged to the upper classes, for many had come in carriages
      and litters, and numerous pedestrians were accompanied by slaves bearing
      in delicately woven baskets and cornucopias a laurel wreath, a papyrus
      crown, or bright-hued flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most aristocratic among the gentlemen had gathered on the western side
      of the great sanctuary, between the cella and the long row of Doric
      columns which supported the roof of the marble temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Macedonian Council of the city was already represented by several of
      its members. Among their number was Archias, Daphne&rsquo;s father, a man of
      middle height and comfortable portliness, from whose well-formed,
      beardless face looked forth a pair of shrewd eyes, and whose quick
      movements revealed the slight irritability of his temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several members of the Council and wealthy merchants surrounded him, while
      the grammateus Proclus first talked animatedly with other government
      officials and representatives of the priesthood, and then with Archias.
      The head of the Museum, who bore the title of &ldquo;high priest,&rdquo; had also
      appeared there with several members of this famous centre of the
      intellectual life of the capital. They shared the shade of this part of
      the temple with distinguished masters of sculpture and painting,
      architecture and poetry, and conversed together with the graceful
      animation of Greeks endowed with great intellectual gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them mingled, distinguishable neither by costume nor language, a
      number of prominent patrons of art in the great Jewish community. Their
      principal, the alabarch, was talking eagerly with the philosopher Hegesias
      and the Rhodian leech Chrysippus; Queen Arsinoe&rsquo;s favourite, whom at
      Althea&rsquo;s instigation she had sent with Proclus to receive the returning
      traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes all gazed toward the mouth of the harbour, where the expected
      ship must soon pass the recently completed masterpiece of Sostratus, the
      towering lighthouse, still shining in its marble purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon many Alexandrians also crowded the large platform in front of the
      Temple of Poseidon, and the very wide marble staircase leading from it to
      the landing place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the bronze statues of the Dioscuri, at the right and left of the
      topmost step, had also gathered the magnificent figures of the Phebi and
      the younger men from the wrestling school of Timagetes, with garlands on
      their curling locks, as well as many younger artists and pupils of the
      older masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statues of the gods and goddesses of the sea and their lofty
      pedestals, standing at the sides of the staircase, cast upon the marble
      steps, gleaming in the radiance of the morning sun, narrow shadows, which
      attracted the male and female chorus singers, who, also wearing beautiful
      garlands, had come to greet the expected arrival with solemn chants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several actors were just coming from rehearsal in the theatre of Dionysus,
      east of the Temple of Poseidon, of which, like all the stages in the city,
      Proclus was chief manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty dancing girl, who hung on the arm of the youngest, extended her
      hand with a graceful gesture toward the staircase, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom can they be expecting there? Probably some huge new animal for the
      Museum which has been caught somewhere for the King, for yonder stiff
      wearer of a laurel crown, who throws his head back as though he would like
      to eat the Olympians and take the King for a luncheon into the bargain, is
      Straton, the denier of the gods, and the little man with the bullethead is
      the grammarian Zoilus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied her companion. &ldquo;But there, too, is Apollodorus, the
      alabarch of the Jews, and the heavy money-bag Archias&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why look at them!&rdquo; cried the younger mime. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far better worth while
      to stretch your neck for those farther in front. They are genuine friends
      of the Muses&mdash;the poets Theocritus and Zenodotus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great Athene, Apollo, and all his nine Pierides, have sent their
      envoys,&rdquo; said the older actor pathetically, &ldquo;for there, too, are the
      sculptors Euphranor and Chares, and the godlike builder of the lighthouse,
      Sostratus in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A handsome man,&rdquo; cried the girl flute-player, &ldquo;but vain, I tell you, vain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Self-conscious, you ought to say,&rdquo; corrected her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; added the older actor, patting his smooth cheeks and chin
      with a rose he held in his hand. &ldquo;Who can defend himself against the
      highest merit, self-knowledge? But the person who is to have this
      reception, by the staff of Dionysus! if modesty flies away from him like
      the bird from a girl, it ought Just look there! The tall, broad-shouldered
      fellow yonder is Chrysippus, the right hand of Arsinoe, as our grammateus
      Proclus is her left. So probably some prince is expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentlemen of the Museum and the great artists yonder would not stir a
      foot, far less lose so precious a morning hour, for any mere wearer of a
      crown or sceptre,&rdquo; protested the other actor; &ldquo;it must be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the King or the Queen command it,&rdquo; interrupted the older player.
      &ldquo;Only Arsinoe is represented here. Or do you see any envoy of Ptolemy?
      Perhaps they will yet arrive. If there were ambassadors of the great Roman
      Senate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; added the dancer, &ldquo;envoys from King Antiochus. But&mdash;goose that
      I am!&mdash;then they would not be received here, but in the royal harbour
      at the Lochias. See if I don&rsquo;t prove to be right! Divine honours are to be
      paid to some newly attracted hero of the intellect. But&mdash;just follow
      my finger! There&mdash;yonder&mdash;it comes floating along at the left of
      the island of Antirrhodus. That may be his galley! Magnificent!
      Wonderfully beautiful! Brilliant! Like a swan! No, no, like a swimming
      peacock! And the silver embroidery on the blue sails! It glitters and
      sparkles like stars in the azure sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the elder actor, shading his eyes with his hand, had been gazing
      at the harbour, where, amid the innumerable vessels, the expected one,
      whose sails were just being reefed, was steered by a skilful hand. Now he
      interrupted the blond beauty with the exclamation: &ldquo;It is Archias&rsquo;s
      Proserpina! I know it well.&rdquo; Then, in a declamatory tone, he continued:
      &ldquo;I, too, was permitted on the deck of the glittering vessel, lightly
      rocked by the crimson waves, to reach my welcome goal; as the guest of
      peerless Archias, I mean. The most magnificent festival in his villa!
      There was a little performance there in which Mentor and I allowed
      ourselves to be persuaded to take part. But just see how the beautiful
      ship uses the narrow passage between the two triremes, as if it had the
      bloodleech&rsquo;s power of contraction! But to return to the festival of
      Archias: the oyster ragout served there, the pheasant pasties&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he interrupted himself, exclaiming in surprise: &ldquo;By the club of
      Hercules, the Proserpina is to be received with a full chorus! And there
      is the owner himself descending the stairs! Whom is she bringing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; cried the dancing girl to her companion, dragging him after
      her, &ldquo;I shall die of curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The singing and shouting of many voices greeted the actors as they
      approached the platform of the Temple of Poseidon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When from this spot the dancer fixed her eyes upon the landing place, she
      suddenly dropped her companion&rsquo;s arm, exclaiming: &ldquo;It is the handsome
      blind sculptor, Hermon, the heir of the wealthy Myrtilus. Do you learn
      this now for the first time, you jealous Thersites? Hail, hail, divine
      Hermon! Hail, noble victim of the ungrateful Olympians! Hail to thee,
      Hermon, and thy immortal works! Hail, hail, hail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile she waved her handkerchief with frenzied eagerness, as if she
      could thus force the blind man to see her, and a group of actors whom
      Proclus, the grammateus of the Dionysian arts, had sent here to receive
      Hermon worthily, followed her example.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her cries were drowned by the singing of the chorus and by thousands
      of shouting voices, while Hermon was embraced by Archias on board the
      galley, and then, by his guidance, stepped on shore and ascended the
      staircase of the Temple of Poseidon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the ship entered the harbour, the artist had had a large goblet of
      unmixed wine given to him, that he might conquer the emotion that had
      overpowered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though his blind eyes did not show him even the faintest outline of a
      figure, he felt as if he was flooded with brilliant sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Proserpina was bearing him past the lighthouse, Gras told him
      that they had now reached the great harbour, and at the same time he heard
      the shouts, whistles, signals, and varying sounds of the landing place
      with its crowded shipping, and of the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      His blood surged in his veins, and before his mind rose the vision of the
      corn-flower blue sky, mirrored in the calm surface of the bluest of seas.
      The pharos built by Sostratus towered in dazzling whiteness above the
      tide, and before him rose the noble temple buildings, palaces, and
      porticoes of the city of Alexandria, with which he was familiar, and
      before and between them statue after statue of marble and bronze, the
      whole flooded with radiant golden light.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, darkness sometimes swallowed this wonderful picture, but an effort
      of the will was sufficient to show it to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Temple of Poseidon!&rdquo; cried Gras. &ldquo;The Proserpina is to land at the
      foot of the steps.&rdquo; And now Hermon listened to the sounds from the shore,
      whose hum and buzz transported him into the midst of the long-missed city
      of commerce, knowledge, and arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the captain&rsquo;s shouts of command fell imperiously upon his ears, the
      strokes of the oars ceased, their blades sank with a loud splash into the
      water, and at the same instant from the temple steps Hermon was greeted by
      the solemn notes of the chorus, from whose rhythm his own name rang forth
      again and again like so many shouts of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought his heart would fairly burst through his arched chest, and the
      passionate violence of its throbbing did not lessen when Gras exclaimed:
      &ldquo;Half Alexandria has assembled to greet you. Ah, if you could only see it!
      How the kerchiefs are waving! Laurel after laurel in every hand! All the
      distinguished people in the capital have gathered on the sacred soil of
      the Temple of Poseidon. There is Archias, too; there are the artists and
      the famous gentlemen of the Museum, the members of the Ephebi, and the
      priests of the great gods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon listened with his hand pressed on his breast, and while doing so
      the power of his imagination showed the vast, harmoniously noble structure
      of the many-pillared Temple of Poseidon, surrounded by as many thousands
      as there were in reality hundreds. From all parts of the sanctuary, even
      from the tops of the roofs, he beheld laurel branches and kerchiefs waving
      and tossing, and wreaths flung on the ground before him. If this picture
      was correct, the whole city was greeting him, headed by the men whom he
      honoured as great and meritorious, and in front of them all Daphne, with
      drooping head, full of feminine grace and heart-winning goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the chorus continued their song, and the welcoming shouts grew
      louder, the brilliant picture faded away, but in return he felt friendly
      arms clasp him. First Archias, then Proclus, and after him a succession of
      fellow-artists-the greatest of all&mdash;drew him into a warm embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he felt himself led away, placed his feet as his Uncle Archias
      whispered directions, and as they gropingly obeyed them ascended the
      temple steps and stood in utter darkness upon the platform listening to
      the speeches which so many had prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the distinguished men in the city expressed their sympathy, their
      pity, their admiration, their hopes, or sent assurances of them to him.
      The Rhodian Chrysippus, despatched by the Queen, delivered the wreath
      which the monarch bestowed, and informed Hermon, with her greetings, that
      Arsinoe deemed his Demeter worthy of the laurel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most famous masters of his art, the great scholars from the Museum,
      the whole priesthood of Demeter, which included Daphne, the servants of
      Apollo, his dear Ephebi, the comrades of his physical exercises&mdash;all
      whom he honoured, admired, loved-loaded him with praises and good wishes,
      as well as the assurance of their pride in numbering him among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      No form, no colour from the visible world, penetrated the darkness
      surrounding him, not even the image of the woman he loved. Only his ears
      enabled him to receive the praises, honours, congratulations lavished here
      and, though he sometimes thought he had received enough, he again listened
      willingly and intently when a new speaker addressed him in warm words of
      eulogy. What share compassion for his unprecedentedly sorrowful fate had
      in this extravagantly laudatory and cordial greeting, he did not ask; he
      only felt with a throbbing heart that he now stood upon a summit which he
      had scarcely ventured to hope ever to attain. His dreams of outward
      success which had not been realized, because he deemed it treason to his
      art to deviate from the course which he believed right and best adapted to
      it, he now, without having yielded to the demands of the old school, heard
      praised as his well-earned possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt as if he breathed the lighter, purer air of the realms of the
      blessed, and the laurel crown which the Queen&rsquo;s envoy pressed upon his
      brow, the wreaths which his fellow-artists presented to him by hands no
      less distinguished than those of the great sculptor Protogenes, and
      Nicias, the most admired artist after the death of Apelles, seemed, like
      the wings on the hat and shoes of Hermes, messenger of the gods, to raise
      him out of himself and into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness surrounded him, yet a bright dazzling light issued from his soul
      and illuminated his whole being with the warm golden radiance of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the faintest shadow dimmed it until Soteles, his fellow-student
      at Rhodes, who sustained him with ardent earnestness in the struggle to
      prefer truth to beauty, greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He welcomed him and wished that he might recover his lost sight as warmly
      as his predecessors. He praised the Demeter, too, but added that this was
      not the place to say what he missed in her. Yet that she did lack it
      awakened in him an emotion of pain, for this, Hermon&rsquo;s last work,
      apparently gave the followers of the ancients a right to number him in
      their ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cautious expression of regret must refer to the head of his Demeter.
      Yet surely it was not his fault that Daphne&rsquo;s features bore the impress of
      that gentle, winning kindness which he himself and Soteles, imitating him,
      had often condemned as weak and characterless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The correctness of his belief was instantly proved to him by the address
      of gray-haired, highly praised Euphranor, who spoke of the Demeter&rsquo;s
      countenance with warm admiration. And how ardently the poets Theocritus
      and Zenodotus extolled his work to the skies!
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid so much laudation, one faint word of dissatisfaction vanished like a
      drop of blood that falls into a clear stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The welcome concluded with a final chant by the chorus, and continued to
      echo in Hermon&rsquo;s ears as he entered his uncle&rsquo;s chariot and drove away
      with him, crowned with laurel and intoxicated as if by fiery wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if he could only have seen his fellow-citizens who so eagerly
      expressed their good will, their sympathy, their admiration! But the black
      and coloured mist before his eyes revealed no human figure, not even that
      of the woman he loved, who, he now learned for the first time from her
      father, had appeared among the priestesses of Demeter to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless he was gladdened by the sound of her voice, the clasp of her
      hand, the faint fragrance of violets exhaling from her fair hair, which he
      had often remembered with so much pleasure when alone in Tennis; but the
      time to devote himself to her fully and completely had not yet come, for
      what manifold and powerful impressions, how much that was elevating,
      delightful, and entertaining awaited him immediately!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen&rsquo;s envoy had expressed his mistress&rsquo;s desire to receive the
      creator of the Demeter, the Ephebi and his fellow-artists had invited him
      to a festival which they desired to give in his honour, and on the way
      Archias informed him that many of his wealthy friends in the Macedonian
      Council expected that he, the honoured hero of the day, would adorn with
      his presence a banquet in their houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a rich, brilliant life awaited him in spite of his blindness! When he
      entered his uncle&rsquo;s magnificent city home, and not only all the servants
      and clients of the family, but also a select party of ladies and gentlemen
      greeted him with flowers and hundreds of other tokens of affection and
      appreciation, he gave himself up without reserve to this novel excess of
      fame and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his blindness, he felt, after the burns on his face had
      healed, thoroughly well, as strong as a giant&mdash;nay, more vigorous and
      capable of enjoyment than ever. What prevented him from revelling to the
      full in the superabundant gifts which Fate, recently so cruel, now
      suddenly cast into his lap with lavish kindness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet many flattering and pleasant things as he had experienced that day, he
      was far from feeling satiety. On entering the hall of the men in his
      uncle&rsquo;s dwelling, the names of famous men and proud beauties had been
      repeated to him. Formerly they had taken little notice of him, yet now
      even the most renowned received him like an Olympian victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did all these vain women really care for him? Yet their favour was
      part of the triumph whose celebration he must permit to-day. His heart
      held but one being for whom it yearned, and with whom thus far he had been
      able only to exchange a few tender greetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time for a long conversation had not yet arrived, but he asked Thyone
      to lead him to her and, while she listened anxiously, described with
      feverish animation the incidents of the last few days. But he soon lowered
      his voice to assure her that he had not ceased to think of her even for a
      single hour, and the feeling of happiness which, in spite of his
      misfortune, had filled and lent wings to his soul, was not least due to
      the knowledge of being near her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her presence really benefited him almost as much as he had anticipated
      during the hours of solitary yearning in Tennis; he felt it a great favour
      of Fate to be permitted to strive to possess her, felt even during the
      delirium of this reception that he loved her. What a tremendous longing to
      clasp her at once in his arms as his betrothed bride overwhelmed him; but
      her father&rsquo;s opposition to the union of his only child with a blind man
      must first be conquered, and the great agitation in his soul, as well as
      the tumult around him, seemed like a mockery of the quiet happiness which
      hovered before him when he thought of his marriage with Daphne. Not until
      everything was calmer would the time come to woo her. Until then both must
      be satisfied with knowing from each other&rsquo;s lips their mutual love, and he
      thought he perceived in the tone of her voice the deep emotion of her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this had prevented Daphne&rsquo;s expressing her congratulations upon
      the success of his Demeter as eagerly and fully as he had expected.
      Painfully disturbed by her reserve, he had just attempted to induce her to
      give a less superficial opinion of his work, when the curtains of the
      dining room parted-the music of flutes, singing, and pleasant odours
      greeted him and the guests. Archias summoned them to breakfast, and a band
      of beautiful boys, with flowers and garlands of ivy, obeyed the command to
      crown them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Thyone approached the newly united pair and, after exchanging a few
      words with Daphne, whispered in an agitated voice to the blind sculptor,
      over whose breast a brown-locked young slave was just twining a garland of
      roses: &ldquo;Poverty no longer stands between you and the object of your love;
      is it Nemesis who even now still seals your lips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon stretched out his hand to draw her nearer to him and murmur softly
      that her counsel had aided him to break the power of the terrible goddess,
      but he grasped the empty air. At the same time the deep voice of his
      love&rsquo;s father, whose opposition threatened to cloud his new happiness,
      singing, flute-playing, and the laughter of fair women greeted him and,
      only half master of his own will, he assented, by a slight bend of the
      head, to the matron&rsquo;s question. A light shiver ran through his frame with
      the speed of lightning, and the Epicurean&rsquo;s maxim that fear and cold are
      companions darted through his brain. But what should he fear? He had
      endured severe trials, it is true, for the sake of remaining faithful to
      truth in art and life; but who probably ever reached the age of manhood
      without once deviating from it? Besides, he was surely aware that, had he
      been obliged to answer Thyone in words, he would not have been guilty of
      the falsehood. His reply had consisted of a slight motion of the head, and
      it negatived nothing; it was merely intended to defer for a short time the
      thing he most desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the rash answer weighed heavily on his mind; but it could no longer be
      recalled that day, and was believed, for Thyone whispered, &ldquo;We shall
      succeed in reconciling the terrible being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the light tremour ran through him, but it lasted only an instant;
      for Chrysilla, the representative of the dead mistress of the house, whose
      duty it was to assign the guests their places, called to Hermon, &ldquo;The
      beautiful Glycera does you the honour of choosing you for a neighbour&rdquo;
       and, before the sentence was finished, Archias himself seized his arm and
      led him to the cushions at the side of the much-courted beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests began the banquet in a very joyous mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greek gaiety, and the quick intellect and keen wit of the Alexandrians,
      combined with the choicest viands of the luxurious capital, where the
      wines and dainties of all the countries of the Mediterranean found sellers
      and buyers, and the cook&rsquo;s vocation was developed into a fine art, to
      spice this banquet with a hundred charms for the mind and senses. To-day
      the principal place in this distinguished circle of famous men, great and
      wealthy nobles, beautiful and aristocratic women, was awarded to the blind
      sculptor. He was pledged by every one who had admired his Demeter, who
      compassionated his sad fate, or who desired to be agreeable to him or his
      host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every kind remark about his person, his blindness, and his masterpiece was
      repeated to him and, after the wine and the effort to attract Daphne&rsquo;s
      attention and shine in the presence of his beautiful neighbour had heated
      and winged his thoughts, he found an apt reply to each noteworthy word.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dessert was finally eaten, and after sunset, in the brilliant
      light of the lamps and candles, greater attention was paid to the mixing
      vessels, all remained silent to listen to his fervid speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glycera had asked him, at the beginning of the banquet, to tell her about
      the attack in Tennis. Now he yielded to her wish that he should repeat the
      captivating tale to the others, and the spirits of the wine helped him to
      perform the task with such animation that his hearers listened to his
      description in breathless suspense, and many eyes rested on the handsome
      face of the great blind artist as if spellbound.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he paused, loud applause rewarded him, and as it reached him from
      every part of the spacious room, his deep, resonant voice put him in
      communication even with the more distant guests, and he might have been
      taken for the symposiarch or director of the banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conspicuous position of the feted artist did not please every one,
      and a rhetorician, famed for his sharp tongue, whispered to his neighbour,
      one of Hermon&rsquo;s older fellow-artists, &ldquo;What his eyes have lost seems to
      benefit his tongue.&rdquo; The sculptor answered: &ldquo;At any rate, the impetuous
      young artist might succeed better in proving himself, by its assistance, a
      good entertainer, than in creating more mediocre masterpieces like the
      Demeter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Similar remarks were made on other cushions; but when the philosopher
      Hegesias asked the famous sculptor Euphranor what he thought of Hermon&rsquo;s
      Demeter, the kindly old man answered, &ldquo;I should laud this noble work as a
      memorable event, even if it did not mark the end, as well as the
      beginning, of its highly gifted creator&rsquo;s new career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing of this kind was uttered near Hermon. Everything that reached him
      expressed delight, admiration, sympathy, and hope. At dessert the
      beautiful Glycera divided her apple, whispering as she gave him one half,
      &ldquo;Let the fruit tell you what the eyes can no longer reveal, you poor and
      yet so abundantly rich darling of the gods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He murmured in reply that his happiness would awake the envy of the
      immortals if, in addition, he were permitted to feast upon the sight of
      her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he been able to see himself, Hermon, who, as a genuine Greek, was
      accustomed to moderate his feelings in intercourse with others, would have
      endeavoured to express the emotions of joy which filled his heart with
      more reserve, and to excel his companions at the festival less recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His enthusiastic delight carried many away with him; others, especially
      Daphne, were filled with anxious forebodings by his conduct, and others
      still with grave displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the latter was the famous leech Erasistratus, who shared Archias&rsquo;s
      cushions, and had been solicited by the latter to try to restore his blind
      nephew&rsquo;s sight. But the kindly physician, who gladly aided even the
      poorest sufferer, curtly and positively refused. To devote his time and
      skill to a blind man who, under the severest of visitations, lulled
      himself so contentedly in happiness, he considered unjust to others who
      desired recovery more ardently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the intoxication of this unbridled strength passes away, and is
      followed by a different mood,&rdquo; remarked the merchant, &ldquo;we will talk of
      this matter again,&rdquo; and the confident tone of his deep voice gave the
      simple sentence such significance that the learned leech held out his
      hand, saying: &ldquo;Only where deep, earnest longing for recovery fills the
      sufferer&rsquo;s mind will the gods aid the physician. We will wait for the
      change which you predict, Archias!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests did not disperse until late, and the best satisfied of all was
      the grammateus Proclus, who had taken advantage of the rich merchant&rsquo;s
      happy mood, and his own warm intercession in behalf of his nephew&rsquo;s work,
      to persuade Archias to advance Queen Arsinoe a large sum of money for an
      enterprise whose object he still carefully concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highly honoured blind artist spent the night under his uncle&rsquo;s roof.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hermon rose from his couch the next morning alert and ready for new
      pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely left the bath when envoys from the Ephebi and the younger
      artists invited him to the festivities which they had arranged in his
      honour. He joyously accepted, and also promised messengers from many of
      Archias&rsquo;s friends, who wished to have the famous blind sculptor among
      their guests, to be present at their banquets.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still felt as if he were intoxicated, and found neither disposition nor
      time for quiet reflection. His great strength, fettered as it were by his
      loss of sight, now also began to stir. Fate itself withheld him from the
      labour which he loved, yet in return it offered him a wealth of varying
      pleasure, whose stimulating power he had learned the day before. He still
      relished the draught from the beaker of homage proffered by his
      fellow-citizens; nay, it seemed as if it could not lose its sweetness for
      a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He joined the ladies before noon, and his newly awakened feeling of joy
      beamed upon them scarcely less radiantly than yesterday. Though Thyone
      might wonder that a man pursued by Nemesis could allow himself to be borne
      along so thoughtlessly by the stream of pleasure, Daphne certainly did not
      grudge him the festal season which, when it had passed, could never return
      to the blind artist. When it was over, he would yearn for the quiet
      happiness at her side, which gazed at him like the calm eyes of the woman
      he loved. With her he would cast anchor for the remainder of his life; but
      first must come the period when he enjoyed the compensation now awarded to
      him for such severe sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart was full of joy as he greeted Daphne and the Lady Thyone, whom
      he found with her; but his warm description of the happy emotion which had
      overpowered him at the abundant honours lavished upon him was interrupted
      by Archias.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his usual quick, brisk manner, he asked whether Hermon wished to occupy
      the beautiful villa with the magnificent garden on Lake Mareotis,
      inherited from Myrtilus, which could scarcely be reached in a vehicle from
      the Brucheium in less than an hour, or the house situated in the centre of
      the city, and Hermon promptly decided in favour of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle, and probably the ladies also, had expected the contrary. Their
      silence showed this plainly enough, and Hermon therefore added in a tone
      of explanation that later the villa would perhaps suit his condition
      better, but now he thought it would be a mistake to retire to the quiet
      which half the city was conspiring to disturb. No one contradicted him,
      and he left the women&rsquo;s apartment with a slight feeling of vexation,
      which, however, was soon jested away by the gay friends who sought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he removed to the city house the next day, he had not yet found time
      for a serious talk with Daphne. His uncle, who had managed the estate of
      Myrtilus, and wished to give Hermon an account of his inheritance, was
      refused by the blind artist, who assured him that he knew Archias had
      greatly increased rather than diminished his property, and thanked him
      sincerely and warmly. In the convenient and spacious city house the young
      sculptor very soon thought he had good reason to be satisfied with his
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of his friends were busy artists, and what loss of time every visit
      to the remote villa would have imposed upon them, what haste he himself
      would have been obliged to use to reach home from the bath, where he often
      spent many hours, from the wrestling school, from the meetings of
      fashionable people in the Paneum gardens, and at sunset by the seashore on
      the royal highway in the Brucheium. All these places were very far from
      the villa. It would have required whole hours, too, to reach a famous
      cookshop in the Canopus, at whose table he liked to assemble beloved
      guests or revel with his friends. The theatre, the Odeum, most of the
      public buildings, as well as the houses of his best friends, and
      especially the beautiful Glycera, were easily reached from his city home,
      and, among the temples, that of Demeter, which he often visited to pray,
      offer sacrifices, and rejoice in the power of attraction which his statue
      of the goddess exerted upon the multitude. It stood at the back of the
      cella in a place accessible to the priesthood alone, visible only through
      the open doors, upon a pedestal which his fellow-artists pronounced rather
      too high. Yet his offer to have it made smaller was not accepted, because
      had it been lower the devout supplicants who stood there to pray could not
      have raised their eyes to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not only at the festivals of the dead that he went to the Greek
      cemetery, where he had had a magnificent monument erected for his dead
      mother. If his head ached after a nocturnal carouse, or the disagreeable
      alarming chill stole over him which he had felt for the first time when he
      falsely answered Thyone that he was still under the ban of Nemesis, he
      went to the family monuments, supplied them with gifts, had sacrifices
      offered to the souls of the beloved dead, and in this way sometimes
      regained a portion of his lost peace of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banquet in the evening always dispelled whatever still oppressed him
      on his return home from these visits, for, though months had elapsed since
      his brilliant reception, he was still numbered, especially in artist
      circles, with the most honoured men; he, the blind man, no longer stood in
      any one&rsquo;s way; conversation gained energy and meaning through the vivacity
      of his fervid intellect, which seemed actually deepened by his blindness
      when questions concerning art were at issue, and from a modest
      fellow-struggler he had become a patron bestowing orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sculptor Soteles, who had followed his footsteps since the
      apprenticeship in Rhodes, was intrusted with the erection of the monument
      to Myrtilus in Tennis, and another highly gifted young sculptor, who
      pursued his former course, with the execution of the one to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a third he ordered a large new mixing vessel of chased silver for the
      society of Ephebi, whose members had lauded him, at the magnificent
      festival given in his honour, with genuine youthful fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the designs for these works his rich and bold gift of invention and the
      power of his imagination proved their full value, and even his older
      fellow-artists followed him with sincere admiration when, in spite of his
      darkened eyes, he brought before them distinctly, and often even with the
      charcoal or wax tablet in his hand, what he had in mind. What magnificent
      things might not this man have created had he retained his sight, what
      masterpieces might not have been expected! and his former works, which had
      been condemned as unlovely, offensive, and exaggerated, were now loudly
      admired; nay, the furious Maenads struggling on the ground and the Street
      Boy Eating Figs, which were no longer his property, were sold at high
      prices. No meeting of artists was complete without Hermon, and the great
      self-possession which success and wealth bestowed, besides his remarkable
      talent and the energy peculiar to him, soon aided him to great influence
      among the members of his profession; nay, he would speedily have reached
      the head of their leaders had not the passionate impetuosity of his
      warlike nature led the more cautious to seek to restrain the powerful
      enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archias&rsquo;s wealthy friends had no such apprehension. To them the lauded
      blind artist was not much more than a costly dish certain to please their
      guests; yet this, too, was no trifle in social circles which spent small
      fortunes for a rare fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the banquets of these princes of commerce he often met Daphne, still
      more frequently the beautiful Glycera, whose husband, an old ship-owner of
      regal wealth, was pleased to see famous men harnessed to his young wife&rsquo;s
      chariot of victory. Hermon&rsquo;s heart had little to do with the flirtation to
      which Glycera encouraged him at every new meeting, and the Thracian Althea
      only served to train his intellect to sharp debates. But in this manner he
      so admirably fulfilled her desire to attract attention that she more than
      once pointed out to the Queen, her relative, the remarkably handsome blind
      man whose acquaintance she had made on a night of mad revel during the
      last Dionysia but one. Althea even thought it necessary to win him, in
      whom she saw the future son-in-law of the wealthy Archias, for through the
      graminateus Proclus the merchant had been persuaded to advance the King&rsquo;s
      wife hundreds of talents, and Arsinoe cherished plans which threatened to
      consume other large sums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyrone watched Hermon&rsquo;s conduct with increasing indignation, while Daphne
      perceived that these women had no more power to estrange her lover from
      her than the bedizened beauties who were never absent from the artists&rsquo; 
      festivals. How totally different was his intercourse with her! His love
      and respect were hers alone; yet she saw in him a soul-sick man, and
      persistently rejected Philotas, who wooed her with the same zeal as
      before, and the other suitors who were striving to win the wealthy
      heiress. She had confessed her feelings to her father, her best friend,
      and persuaded him to have patience a little longer, and wait for the
      change which he himself expected in his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had not been difficult, for Archias loved Hermon, in spite of the
      many anxieties he had caused him, as if he were his own son and, knowing
      his daughter, he was aware that she could be happy with the man who
      possessed her heart though he was deprived of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fame which Hermon had won by great genius and ability had gratified
      him more than he expressed, and he could not contradict Daphne when she
      asserted that, in spite of the aimless life of pleasure to which he
      devoted himself, he had remained the kind-hearted, noble man he had always
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, he used, unasked and secretly, a considerable portion of his
      large revenues to relieve the distress of the poor and suffering. Archias
      learned this as the steward of his nephew&rsquo;s property, and when to do good
      he made new demands upon him, he gladly fulfilled them; only he constantly
      admonished the blind man to think of his own severe sufferings and his
      cure. Daphne did the same, and he willingly obeyed her advice; for, loudly
      and recklessly as he pursued pleasure in social circles, he showed himself
      tenderly devoted to her when he found her alone in her father&rsquo;s house.
      Then, as in better days, he opened his heart to her naturally and modestly
      and, though he refrained from vows of love, he showed her that he did not
      cease to seek with her, and her alone, what his noisy pleasures denied.
      Then he also found the old tone of affection, and of late he came more
      frequently, and what he confided to no one else implied to her, at least
      by hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satiety and dissatisfaction were beginning to appear, and what he had
      attempted to do for the cure of his eyes had hitherto been futile. The
      remedies of the oculists to whom he had been directed by Daphne herself
      had proved ineffectual. The great physician Erasistratus, from whom he
      first sought help, had refrained, at her entreaty and her father&rsquo;s, from
      refusing to aid him, but indignantly sent him away when he persisted in
      the declaration that it would be impossible for him to remain for months
      secluded from all society and subsist for weeks on scanty fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would submit even to that, he assured Daphne, after she represented to
      him what he was losing by such lack of resignation, when the time of rest
      had come for which he longed, but from which many things still withheld
      him. Yesterday the King had invited him to the palace for the first time,
      and to decline such an honour was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, he had long wished for this summons, because he had been informed
      that no representative of the sovereign had been present at his reception.
      Only his wife Arsinoe had honoured him by a wreath and congratulations.
      This lack of interest on the part of the King had wounded him, and the
      absence of an invitation from the royal connoisseur had cast a shadow into
      the midst of many a mirthful hour. He had doubtless been aware what great
      and important affairs of state were claiming the conscientious sovereign
      just at this time, and how almost unbearable his restless, unloving spouse
      was rendering his domestic life; yet Hermon thought Ptolemy might have
      spared a short time for an event in the art life of the city, as his
      Demeter had been called hundreds of times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the long-desired command to appear before the sovereign had finally
      reached him, and, in the secure belief that it would bring fresh
      recognition and rare honours, he entered the royal palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proclus, who neglected no opportunity of serving the nephew of the rich
      man whose aid he constantly required for the Queen&rsquo;s finances, was his
      guide, and described the decoration of the inner apartments of the royal
      residence. Their unostentatious simplicity showed the refined taste of
      their royal occupant. There was no lack of marble and other rare kinds of
      stone, and the numerous bas-reliefs which covered the walls like the most
      superb tapestry were worthy of special attention. In the oblong apartment
      through which the blind man was guided these marble pictures represented
      in magnificent work scenes from the campaigns in which Ptolemy, the King&rsquo;s
      father, had participated as Alexander&rsquo;s general. Others showed Athene,
      Apollo, the Muses, and Hermes, surrounding or hastening toward the throne
      of the same monarch, and others again Greek poets and philosophers.
      Magnificent coloured mosaic pictures covered the floor and many flat
      spaces above door and windows, but gold and silver had been sparingly
      used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Masterpieces of painting and sculpture were the ornaments of the room. In
      the antechamber, where Hermon waited for the King, Proclus mentioned one
      of the finest statues of Alexander by Lysippus, and an exquisite Eros by
      Praxiteles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of waiting, however, became so long to the spoiled artist that
      he anticipated the monarch&rsquo;s appearance with painful discomfort, and the
      result of the few minutes which Ptolemy II devoted to his reception was
      far behind the hopes he had fixed upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In former days he had often seen the narrow-shouldered man of barely
      medium height who, to secure his own safety, had had two brothers killed
      and sent another into exile, but now ruled Egypt shrewdly and prudently,
      and developed the prosperity of Alexandria with equal energy and
      foresight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the first time, Hermon heard him speak. He could not deny that
      his voice was unusually pleasant in tone, yet it unmistakably issued from
      the lips of a sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brief questions with which he received the blind artist were kindly,
      and as natural as though addressing an equal, and every remark made in
      connection with Hermon&rsquo;s answers revealed a very quick and keen intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen the Demeter, and praised the conception of the goddess because
      it corresponded with her nature. The sanctity which, as it were, pervaded
      the figure of the divine woman pleased him, because it made the
      supplicants in the temple feel that they were in the presence of a being
      who was elevated far above them in superhuman majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;your Demeter is by no means a powerful helper in time
      of need. She is a goddess such as Epicurus imagines the immortals. Without
      interfering with human destiny, she stands above it in sublime grandeur
      and typical dignity. You belong, if I see correctly, to the Epicureans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hermon. &ldquo;Like my lord and King, I, too, number myself among
      the pupils of the wise Straton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; asked Ptolemy in a drawling tone, at the same time casting a
      glance of astonishment at the blind man&rsquo;s powerful figure and well-formed,
      intellectual face. Then he went on eagerly: &ldquo;I shall scarcely be wrong in
      the inference that you, the creator of the Fig-eater, had experienced a
      far-reaching mental change before your unfortunate loss of sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to struggle hard,&rdquo; replied Hermon, &ldquo;but I probably owe the success
      of the Demeter to the circumstance that I found a model whose mind and
      nature correspond with those of the goddess to a rare degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The monarch shook his fair head, and protested in a tone of positive
      superior knowledge: &ldquo;As to the model, however well selected it may be, it
      was not well chosen for this work, far less for you. I have watched your
      battle against beauty in behalf of truth, and rejoiced, though I often saw
      you and your little band of young disciples shoot beyond the mark. You
      brought something new, whose foundation seemed to me sound, and on which
      further additions might be erected. When the excrescences fell off, I
      thought, this Hermon, his shadow Soteles, and the others who follow him
      will perhaps open new paths to the declining art which is constantly going
      back to former days. Our time will become the point of departure of a new
      art. But for that very reason, let me confess it, I regret to see you fall
      back from your bold advance. You now claim for your work that it cleaves
      strictly to Nature, because the model is taken from life itself. It does
      not become me to doubt this, yet the stamp of divinity which your Demeter
      bears is found in no mortal woman. Understand me correctly! This is
      certainly no departure from the truth, for the ideal often deserves this
      lofty name better than anything the visible world offers to the eye; but
      hitherto you have done honour to another truth. If I comprehend your art
      aright, its essence is opposed to the addition of superhuman dignity and
      beauty, with which you, or the model you used, strove to ennoble and deify
      your Demeter. Admirably as you succeeded in doing so, it forces your work
      out of the sphere of reality, whose boundary I never before saw you cross
      by a single inch. Whether this occurred unconsciously to you in an hour of
      mental ecstasy, or whether you felt that you still lacked the means to
      represent the divine, and therefore returned to the older methods, I do
      not venture to decide. But at the first examination of your work I was
      conscious of one thing: It means for you a revolution, a rupture with your
      former aspirations; and as&mdash;I willingly confess it&mdash;you had been
      marvellously successful, it would have driven you, had your sight been
      spared, out of your own course and into the arms of the ancients, perhaps
      to your material profit, but scarcely to the advantage of art, which needs
      a renewal of its vital energies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me assure you, my lord,&rdquo; Hermon protested, &ldquo;that had I remained able
      to continue to create, the success of the Demeter would never, never have
      rendered me faithless to the conviction and method of creation which I
      believed right; nay, before losing my sight, my whole soul was absorbed in
      a new work which would have permitted me to remain wholly and completely
      within the bounds of reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Arachne?&rdquo; asked the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; cried Hermon ardently. &ldquo;With its completion I expected to
      render the greatest service, not only to myself, but to the cause of
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Ptolemy interrupted with icy coldness: &ldquo;Yet you were certainly wrong;
      at least, if the Thracian Althea, who is the personification of falsehood,
      had continued to be the model.&rdquo; Then he changed his tone, and with the
      exclamation: &ldquo;You are protected from the needs of life, unless your rich
      uncle throws his property into the most insatiable of gulfs. May Straton&rsquo;s
      philosophy help you better to sustain your courage in the darkness which
      surrounds you than it has aided me to bear other trials!&rdquo; he left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended the artist&rsquo;s conversation with the King, from which Hermon had
      expected such great results and, deeply agitated, he ordered the driver of
      his horses to take him to Daphne. She was the only person to whom he could
      confide what disappointment this interview had caused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others had previously reproached him, as the King had just done, with
      having, in the Demeter, become faithless to his artistic past. How false
      and foolish this was! Many a remark from the critics would have been
      better suited to Myrtilus&rsquo;s work than to his. Yet his fear in Tennis had
      not been true. Only Daphne&rsquo;s sweet face did not suit his more vigorous
      method of emphasizing distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a many-hued chameleon was the verdict upon works of plastic art! Once&mdash;on
      his return to the capital&mdash;thousands had united in the same one, and
      now how widely they differed again!
    </p>
    <p>
      His earlier works, which were now lauded to the skies, had formerly
      invited censure and vehement attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would he not have given for the possibility of seeing his admired
      work once more!
    </p>
    <p>
      As his way led past the Temple of Demeter, he stopped near it and was
      guided to the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was filled with worshippers, and when, in his resolute manner, he told
      the curator and the officiating priest that he wished to enter the cella,
      and asked for a ladder to feel the goddess, he was most positively
      refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he requested seemed a profanation of the sacred image, and it would
      not do to disturb the devout throng. His desire to lower the pedestal
      could not be gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high priest who came forward upheld his subordinates and, after a
      short dispute, Hermon left the sanctuary with his wish unfulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had he so keenly lamented his lost vision as during the remainder of
      the drive, and when Daphne received him he described with passionate
      lamentation how terribly blindness embittered his life, and declared
      himself ready to submit to the severest suffering to regain his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She earnestly entreated him to apply to the great physician Erasistratus
      again, and Hermon willingly consented. He had promised to attend a banquet
      given that day by the wealthy ship-owner Archon. The feast lasted until
      early morning, but toward noon Hermon again appeared in his uncle&rsquo;s house,
      and met Daphne full of joyous confidence, as if he were completely
      transformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at Archon&rsquo;s table he had determined to place his cure in the hands
      of higher powers. This was the will of Fate; for the guest whose cushion
      he shared was Silanus, the host&rsquo;s son, and the first thing he learned from
      him was the news that he was going the next day, with several friends, to
      the oracle of Amon in the Libyan Desert, to ask it what should be done for
      his mother, who had been for several years an invalid whom no physician
      could help. He had heard from many quarters that the counsel of the god,
      who had greeted Alexander the Great as his son, was infallible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hermon had been most urgently pressed by the young man to accompany
      him. Every comfort would be provided. One of his father&rsquo;s fine ships would
      convey them to Paraetonium, where tents, saddle horses, and guides for the
      short land journey would be ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he had promised to go with Silanus, and his decision was warmly
      approved by his uncle, Daphne, and the gray-haired Pelusinian couple.
      Perhaps the god would show the blind man the right path to recovery. He
      would always be able to call the skill of the Alexandrian leeches to his
      aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after Hermon went on board Archon&rsquo;s splendidly equipped vessel and,
      instead of a tiresome journey, began a new and riotous period of
      festivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavish provision had been made for gay companions of both sexes, merry
      entertainment by means of dancing, music, and song, well filled dishes and
      mixing vessels, and life during the ride through the coast and desert
      regions was not less jovial and luxurious than on the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to the blind man like one vast banquet in the dark, interrupted
      only by sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hope of counsel from the gods cheered the depressed mood which had
      weighed upon him for several weeks, and rich young Silanus praised the
      lucky fate which had enabled him to find a travelling companion whose
      intellect and wit charmed him and the others, and often detained them over
      the wine until late into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, too, Hermon felt himself the most distinguished person, the
      animating and attracting power, until it was said that the voyage was
      over, and the company pitched their tents in the famous oasis near the
      Temple of Amon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musicians and dancers, with due regard to propriety, had been left
      behind in the seaport of Paraetonium. Yet the young travellers were
      sufficiently gay while Silanus and Hermon waited for admission to the
      place of the oracle. A week after their arrival it was opened to them, yet
      the words repeated to them by the priest satisfied neither Hermon nor
      Archon&rsquo;s son, for the oracle advised the latter to bring his mother
      herself to the oasis by the land road if she earnestly desired recovery,
      while to Hermon was shouted the ambiguous saying:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Only night and darkness spring from the rank marsh of pleasure;
   Morning and day rise brightly from the starving sand.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Could Silanus&rsquo;s mother, who was unable to move, endure the desert journey?
      And what was the meaning of the sand, from which morning and day&mdash;which
      was probably the fresh enjoyment of the light&mdash;were to rise for
      Hermon? The sentence of the oracle weighed heavily upon him, as well as on
      Archon&rsquo;s son, who loved his mother, and the homeward journey became to the
      blind man by no means a cheerful but rather a very troubled dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughtful, very disturbed, dissatisfied with himself, and resolved to
      turn his back upon the dreary life of pleasure which for so long a time
      had allowed him no rest, and now disgusted him, he kept aloof from his
      travelling companions, and rejoiced when, at Alexandria, he was led ashore
      in the harbour of Eunostus.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Hermon entered his house with drooping head.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Here he was informed that the grammateus of the Dionysian artists had
      already called twice to speak to him concerning an important matter. When
      he came from the bath, Proclus visited him again. His errand was to invite
      him to a banquet which was to take place that evening at his residence in
      a wing of the royal palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel, and he frankly
      said so, although immediately after his return he had accepted the
      invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would
      give the following day in honour of the seventieth birthday of the old
      sculptor Euphranor. The grammateus alluded to this, and most positively
      insisted that he could not release him; for he came not only by his own
      wish, but in obedience to the command of Queen Arsinoe, who desired to
      tell the creator of the Demeter how highly she esteemed his work and his
      art. She would appear herself at dessert, and the banquet must therefore
      begin at an unusually early hour. He, Proclus, was to have the high honour
      of including the royal lady among his guests solely on Hermon&rsquo;s account,
      and his refusal would be an insult to the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition. He did
      this reluctantly; but the Queen&rsquo;s attention to him and his art flattered
      his vanity and, if he was to abandon the intoxicating and barren life of
      pleasure, it could scarcely be done more worthily than at a festival where
      the King&rsquo;s consort intended to distinguish him in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banquet was to begin in a few hours, yet he could not let the day pass
      without seeing Daphne and telling her the words of the oracle. He longed,
      with ardent yearning, for the sound of her voice, and still more to
      unburden his sorely troubled soul to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if only his Myrtilus still walked among the living! How totally
      different, in spite of his lost vision, would his life have been!
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne was now the only one whom he could put in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his return from the oracle, the fear that the rescued Demeter might
      yet be the work of Myrtilus had again mastered him. However loudly outward
      circumstances might oppose this, he now felt, with a certainty which
      surprised him, that this work was not his own. The approval, as well as
      the doubts, which it aroused in others strengthened his opinion, although
      even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts.
      How deep had been the intoxication in which he had so long reeled from one
      day to the next, since it had succeeded in keeping every doubt of the
      authorship of this work far from him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he must obtain certainty, and Daphne could help him to it; for, as a
      priestess of Demeter, she possessed the right to procure him access to the
      cella and get permission for him to climb the lofty pedestal and feel the
      statue with his fingers, whose sense of touch had become much keener.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would frankly inform her of his fear, and her truthful nature would
      find the doubt that gnawed his heart as unendurable as he himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been a grave crime to woo her before he was relieved of this
      uncertainty, and he would utter the decisive words that very day, and ask
      her whether her love was great enough to share the joys and sorrows of
      life with him, the blind man, who perhaps must also divest himself of a
      false fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called at Archias&rsquo;s house with a wreath on his head and in festal
      robes; but Daphne was in the temple, whither old Philippus and Thyone had
      gone, and his uncle was attending a late session of the Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have liked to follow Daphne to the sanctuary, but the late hour
      forbade it, and he therefore only charged Gras to tell his young mistress
      that he was going to Proclus&rsquo;s banquet, and would return early the next
      morning to discuss a most important subject with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went directly to the neighbouring palace. The Queen might have
      appeared already, and it would not do to keep her waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware that she lived at variance with her husband, but how could he
      have suspected that she cherished the more than bold design of hurling the
      sovereign from his throne and seizing the Egyptian crown herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proclus and Althea were among the conspirators who supported Arsinoe, and
      the Queen thought it would be an easy matter to win over to her cause and
      herself the handsome sculptor, whom she remembered at the last Dionysia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wealthy blind artist, so highly esteemed among the members of his
      profession, might become valuable to the conspiracy, for she knew what
      enthusiastic devotion the Alexandrian artists felt for the King, and
      everything depended upon forming a party in her own favour among them.
      This task was to fall to Hermon, and also another, still more important
      one; for he, his nephew and future son-in-law, if any one, could persuade
      the wealthy Archias to lend the plot his valuable aid. Hitherto the
      merchant had been induced, it is true, to advance large sums of money to
      the Queen, but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had
      rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy. Althea,
      however, declared that the blind man&rsquo;s marriage to Daphne was only a
      question of time, and Proclus added that the easily excited nephew would
      show himself more pliant than the uncle if Arsinoe exerted upon him the
      irresistible charm of her personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hermon entered the residence of the grammateus in the palace, the
      guests had already assembled. The Queen was not to appear until after the
      feast, when the mixing jars were filled. The place by Hermon&rsquo;s side, which
      Althea had chosen for herself, would then be given up to Arsinoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sovereign was as unaccustomed to the society of a blind artist as
      Hermon was to that of a queen, and both eagerly anticipated the
      approaching meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was difficult for Hermon to turn a bright face toward his
      companion. The sources of anxiety and grief which had previously burdened
      his mind would not vanish, even under the roof of the royal palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Althea&rsquo;s presence reminded him of Tennis, Ledscha, and Nemesis, who for so
      long a time seemed to have suspended her persecution, but since he had
      returned from the abode of the oracle was again asserting the old right to
      him. During many a sleepless hour of the night he had once more heard the
      rolling of her terrible wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before the journey to the oasis of Amon, everything life could offer
      him, the idle rake, in his perpetual darkness, had seemed shallow and
      scarcely worth stretching out his hand for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, an interesting conversation still had power to charm him, but often
      during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced
      itself upon his mind; for the majority of the subjects discussed by the
      artists came to them through the medium of sight, and referred to new
      creations of architecture, sculpture, and painting, from whose enjoyment
      his blindness debarred him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When returning home from a banquet, if his way lay through the city, he
      was reminded of the superb buildings, marble terraces and fountains,
      statues and porticoes, which had formerly satiated his eyes with delight,
      and must now be illumined with a brilliant radiance by the morning
      sunbeams, though a hostile fate shut them out from his eyes, starving and
      thirsting for beautiful forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it had seemed to him still harder to bear that his blinded eyes
      refused to show him the most beautiful of all beautiful things, the human
      form, when he lingered among the Ephebi or the spectators of a festal
      procession, or visited the gymnasium, the theatre, the Aphrodisium, or the
      Paneum gardens, where the beautiful women met at sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen was to appear immediately, and when she took her place near him
      his blindness would again deprive him of the sight of her delicately cut
      features, prevent his returning the glances from her sparkling eyes, and
      admiring the noble outlines of her thinly veiled figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would his troubled spirit at least permit him to enjoy and enter without
      restraint into the play of her quick wit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps her arrival would relieve him from the discomfort which oppressed
      him here.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger, out of his own sphere, he felt chilled among these closely
      united men and women, to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the
      same host.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not acquainted with a single individual except the mythograph
      Crates, who for several months had been one of the members of the Museum,
      and who had attached himself to Hermon at Straton&rsquo;s lectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist was surprised to find this man in such a circle, but he learned
      from Althea that the young member of the Museum was a relative of Proclus,
      and a suitor of the beautiful Nico, one of the Queen&rsquo;s ladies in waiting,
      who was among the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crates had really been invited in order to win him over to the Queen&rsquo;s
      cause; but charming fair-haired Nico had been commissioned by the
      conspirators to persuade him to sing Arsinoe&rsquo;s praises among his
      professional associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the men present stood in close connection with Arsinoe, and
      were fellow-conspirators against her husband&rsquo;s throne and life. The ladies
      whom Proclus had invited were all confidants of Arsinoe, the wives and
      daughters of his other guests. All were members of the highest class of
      society, and their manners showed the entire freedom from restraint that
      existed in the Queen&rsquo;s immediate circle. Althea profited by the advantage
      of being Hermon&rsquo;s only acquaintance here. So, when he took his place on
      the cushion at her side, she greeted him familiarly and cordially, as she
      had treated him for a long time, wherever they met, and in a low voice
      told him, sometimes in a kindly tone, sometimes with biting sarcasm, the
      names and characters of the other guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most aristocratic was Amyntas, who stood highest of all in the Queen&rsquo;s
      favour because he had good reason to hate the other Arsinoe, the sister of
      the King. His son had been this royal dame&rsquo;s first husband, and she had
      deserted him to marry Lysimachus, the aged King of Thrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rhodian Chrysippus, her leech and trusted counsellor, also possessed
      great influence over the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The noble lady,&rdquo; whispered Althea, &ldquo;needs the faithful devotion of every
      well-disposed subject, for perhaps you have already learned how cruelly
      the King embitters the life of the mother of his three children. Many a
      caprice can be forgiven the suffering Ptolemy, who recently expressed a
      wish that he could change places with the common workmen whom he saw
      eating their meal with a good appetite, and who is now tortured by the
      gout; yet he watches the hapless woman with the jealousy of a tiger,
      though he himself is openly faithless to her. What is the Queen to him,
      since the widow of Lysimachus returned from Thrace&mdash;no, from
      Cassandrea, Ephesus, and sacred Samothrace, or whatever other places there
      are which would no longer tolerate the murderess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s sister&mdash;the object of his love?&rdquo; cried Hermon
      incredulously. &ldquo;She must be forty years old now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; Althea assented. &ldquo;But we are in Egypt, where marriages
      between brothers and sisters are pleasing to gods and men; and besides, we
      make our own moral laws here. Her age! We women are only as old as we
      look, and the leeches and tiring women of this beauty of forty practise
      arts which give her the appearance of twenty-five, yet perhaps the King
      values her intellect more than her person, and the wisdom of a hundred
      serpents is certainly united in this woman&rsquo;s head. She will make our poor
      Queen suffer unless real friends guard her from the worst. The three most
      trustworthy ones are here: Amyntas, the leech Chrysippus, and the
      admirable Proclus. Let us hope that you will make this three-leaved clover
      the luck-promising four-leaved one. Your uncle, too, has often with
      praiseworthy generosity helped Arsinoe in many an embarrassment. Only make
      the acquaintance of this beautiful royal lady, and the last drop of your
      blood will not seem too precious to shed for her! Besides&mdash;Proclus
      told me so in confidence&mdash;you have little favour to expect from the
      King. How long he kept you waiting for the first word concerning a work
      which justly transported the whole city with delight! When he did finally
      summon you, he said things which must have wounded you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is going too far,&rdquo; replied Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he kept back his real opinion,&rdquo; Althea protested. &ldquo;Had I not made it
      a rule to maintain absolute silence concerning everything I hear in
      conversation from those with whom I am closely associated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she was interrupted by Chrysippus, who asked if Althea had told her
      neighbour about his Rhodian eye-salve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke, and then
      informed the blind artist how graciously Arsinoe had remembered him when
      she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eyes
      had been made in Rhodes. The royal lady had inquired about him and his
      sufferings with almost sisterly interest, and Althea eagerly confirmed the
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon listened to the pair in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been able to see them, it is true, yet he had perceived their
      design as if the loss of sight had sharpened his mental vision. He
      imagined that he could see the favourite and Althea nudge each other with
      sneering gestures, and believed that their sole purpose was to render him&mdash;he
      knew not for what object&mdash;the obedient tool of the Queen, who had
      probably also succeeded in persuading his usually cautious uncle to render
      her great services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of Arsinoe&rsquo;s undignified conduct at the Dionysia, and the
      shameful stories of her which he had heard returned to his mind. At the
      same time he saw Daphne rise before him in her aristocratic dignity and
      kindly goodness, and a smile of satisfaction hovered around his lips as he
      said to himself: &ldquo;The spider Althea again! But, in spite of my blindness,
      I will be caught neither in her net nor in the Queen&rsquo;s. They are the last
      to bar the way which leads to Daphne and real happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rhodian was just beginning to praise Arsinoe also as a special friend
      and connoisseur of the sculptor&rsquo;s art when Crates, Hermon&rsquo;s
      fellow-student, asked the blind artist, in behalf of his beautiful
      companion, why his Demeter was placed upon a pedestal which, to others as
      well as himself, seemed too high for the size of the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon replied that he had heard several make this criticism, but the
      priests of the goddess refused to take it into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he hesitated, for, like a blow from an invisible hand, the thought
      darted through his mind that perhaps, on the morrow, he would see himself
      compelled before the whole world to cast aside the crown of fame which he
      owed to the statue on the lofty pedestal. He did not have even the
      remotest idea of continuing to deck himself with false renown if his dread
      was realized; yet he doubtless imagined how this whole aristocratic
      circle, with the Queen, Althea, and Proclus at its head, would turn with
      reckless haste from the hapless man who had led them into such a shameful
      error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet what mattered it, even if these miserable people considered themselves
      deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him? Better people would
      thereby be robbed of the right to accuse him of faithlessness to himself.
      This thought darted through his heated brain like a flash of lightning,
      and when, in spite of his silence, the conversation was continued and
      Althea told the others that only Hermon&rsquo;s blindness had prevented the
      creation of a work which could have been confidently expected far to
      surpass the Demeter, since it seemed to have been exactly suited to his
      special talent, he answered his beautiful companion&rsquo;s remark curtly and
      absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She perceived this with annoyance and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman who yearns for the regard of all men, and makes love a toy, easily
      lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals. Only, even though love
      has wholly disappeared, she still claims consideration, and Althea did not
      wish to lose Hermon&rsquo;s regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Amyntas, the head of the conspirators, attracted the attention of the
      company by malicious remarks about the King&rsquo;s sister, the Thracian laid
      her hand on the blind artist&rsquo;s arm, whispering: &ldquo;Has the image of the
      Arachne which, at Tennis, charmed you even in the presence of the angry
      Zeus, completely vanished from your memory? How indifferent you look! But
      I tell you&rdquo;&mdash;her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;that so
      long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different.
      Even while putting the last touches of the file to the Demeter, for which
      Archias&rsquo;s devout daughter posed as your model, another whom you could not
      banish from your mind filled your imagination. Though so loud a denial is
      written on your face, I persist in my conviction, and that no idle
      delusion ensnares me I can prove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon raised his sightless eyes to her inquiringly, but she went on with
      eager positiveness: &ldquo;Or, if you did not think of the weaver while carving
      the goddess, how did you happen to engrave a spider on the ribbon twined
      around the ears of grain in Demeter&rsquo;s hand? Not the smallest detail of a
      work produced by the hand of a valued friend escapes my notice, and I
      perceived it before the Demeter came to the temple and the lofty pedestal.
      Now I would scarcely be able to discover it in the dusky cella, yet at
      that time I took pleasure in the sight of the ugly insect, not only
      because it is cleverly done, but because it reminded me of something&rdquo;&mdash;here
      she lowered her voice still more&mdash;&ldquo;that pleased me, though probably
      it would seem less flattering to the daughter of Archias, who perhaps is
      better suited to act as guide to the blind. How bewildered you look!
      Eternal gods! Many things are forgotten after long months have passed, but
      it will be easy for me to sharpen your memory. &lsquo;At the time Hermon had
      just finished the Demeter,&rsquo; the spider called to me, &lsquo;he scratched me on
      the gold.&rsquo; But at that very time&mdash;yes, my handsome friend, I can
      reckon accurately&mdash;you had met me, Althea, in Tennis, I had brought
      the spider-woman before your eyes. Was it really nothing but foolish
      vanity that led me to the conviction that you were thinking of me also
      when you engraved on the ribbon the despised spider-for which, however, I
      always felt a certain regard&mdash;with the delicate web beneath its
      slender legs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Hermon had listened to every word in silence, labouring for
      breath. He was transported as if by magic to the hour of his return from
      Pelusium; he saw himself enter Myrtilus&rsquo;s studio and watch his friend
      scratch something, he did not know what, upon the ribbon which fastened
      the bunch of golden grain. It was&mdash;nay, it could have been nothing
      else&mdash;that very spider. The honoured work was not his, but his dead
      friend&rsquo;s. How the exchange had occurred he could not now understand, but
      to disbelieve that it had taken place would have been madness or
      self-deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he also understood the doubts of Soteles and the King. Not he&mdash;Myrtilus,
      and he alone, was the creator of the much-lauded Demeter!
    </p>
    <p>
      This conviction raised a hundred-pound weight from his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was applause! What was recognition! What were fame and laurel
      wreaths! He desired clearness and truth for himself and all the world and,
      as if frantic, he suddenly sprang from his cushions, shouting to the
      startled guests: &ldquo;I myself and this whole great city were deceived! The
      Demeter is not mine, not the work of Hermon! The dead Myrtilus created
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then pressing his hand to his brow, he called his student friend to his
      side, and, as the scholar anxiously laid his arm on his shoulder,
      whispered: &ldquo;Away, away from here! Only let me get out of doors into the
      open air!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crates, bewildered and prepared for the worst, obeyed his wish; but Althea
      and the other guests left behind felt more and more impressed by the
      suddenly awakened conviction that the hapless blind man had now also
      become the victim of madness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Without a word of explanation, Hermon dragged his guide along in
      breathless haste. No one stopped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atrium, usually swarming with guards, servants, and officials until a
      far later hour, was completely deserted when the blind man hurried through
      it with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door leading into the outer air stood open, but Hermon, leaning on the
      scholar&rsquo;s arm, had scarcely crossed the threshold and entered the little
      courtyard encircled with ornamental plants, which separated this portion
      of the palace from the street, when both were surrounded by a band of
      armed Macedonian soldiers, whose commander exclaimed: &ldquo;In the name of the
      King! Not a sound, if you value your lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Incensed, and believing that there was some mistake, Hermon announced
      himself as a sculptor and Crates as a member of the Museum, but this
      statement did not produce the slightest effect upon the warrior; nay, when
      the friends answered the officer&rsquo;s inquiry whether they were coming from
      Proclus&rsquo;s banquet in the affirmative; he curtly commanded them to be put
      in chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      To offer resistance would have been madness, for even Hermon perceived, by
      the loud clanking of weapons around them, the greatly superior power of
      the enemy, and they were acting by the orders of the King. &ldquo;To the prison
      near the place of execution!&rdquo; cried the officer; and now not only the
      mythograph, but Hermon also was startled&mdash;this dungeon opened only to
      those sentenced to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he to be led to the executioner&rsquo;s block? A cold shudder ran through
      his frame; but the next moment he threw back his waving locks, and his
      chest heaved with a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      What pleasure had life to offer him, the blind man, who was already dead
      to his art? Ought he not to greet this sudden end as a boon from the
      immortals?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be
      imagined?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had already taken care that the false renown should not follow him to
      the grave, and Myrtilus should have his just due, and he would do whatever
      else lay in his power to further this object. Wherever the beloved dead
      might be, he desired to go there also. Whatever might await him, he
      desired no better fate. If he had passed into annihilation, he, Hermon,
      wished to follow him thither, and annihilation certainly meant redemption
      from pain and misery. But if he were destined to meet his Myrtilus and his
      mother in the world beyond the grave, what had he not to tell them, how
      sure he was of finding a joyful reception there from both! The power which
      delivered him over to death just at that moment was not Nemesis&mdash;no,
      it was a kindly deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only his heart grew heavy at the thought of leaving Daphne to the tireless
      wooer Philotas or some other&mdash;everything else from which it is
      usually hard to part seemed like a burden that we gladly cast aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; he called blithely and boldly to the officer; while Crates,
      with loud lamentations, was protesting his innocence to the warrior who
      was putting fetters upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chain was just being clasped around Hermon&rsquo;s wrists also when he
      suddenly started. His keen ear could not deceive him, and yet a demon must
      be mocking him, for the voice that had called his name was the girl&rsquo;s of
      whom, in the presence of welcome death, he had thought with longing
      regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was no illusion that deceived him. Again he heard the beloved
      voice, and this time it addressed not only him, but with the utmost haste
      the commander of the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes with touching entreaty, sometimes with imperious command, she
      protested, after giving him her name, that this matter could be nothing
      but an unfortunate mistake. Lastly, with earnest warmth, she besought him,
      before taking the prisoners away, to permit her to speak to the commanding
      general, Philippus, her father&rsquo;s guest, who, she was certain, was in the
      palace. The blood of these innocent men would be on his head if he did not
      listen to her representations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daphne!&rdquo; cried Hermon in grateful agitation; but she would not listen to
      him, and followed the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into
      the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments, which the blind artist used to inspire the despairing
      scholar with courage, the girl returned, and she did not come alone. The
      gray-haired comrade of Alexander accompanied her, and after a few minutes
      both prisoners were released from their fetters. Philippus hastily refused
      their thanks and, after addressing a few words to the officer, he changed
      his tone, and his deep voice sounded paternally cordial as he exclaimed to
      Daphne: &ldquo;Fifteen minutes more, you dear, foolhardy girl, and it would have
      been too late. To-morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously
      directed you to this dangerous path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, he turned to the prisoners to explain that they would be conducted
      to the adjacent barracks of the Diadochi, and spend the night there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning they should be examined, and, if they could clear
      themselves from the suspicion of belonging to the ranks of the
      conspirators, released.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners, but Philippus
      silenced her with the grave exclamation, &ldquo;The order of the King!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old commander offered no objection to her wish to accompany Hermon to
      prison. Daphne now slipped her arm through her cousin&rsquo;s, and commanded the
      steward Gras, who had brought her here, to follow them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the nocturnal walk, which was close at hand, was reached at
      the end of a few minutes, and the prisoners were delivered to the
      commander of the Diadochi. This kindly disposed officer had served under
      Hermon&rsquo;s father, and when the names of the prisoners were given, and the
      officer reported to him that General Philippus recommended them to his
      care as innocent men, he had a special room opened for the sculptor and
      his fair guide, and ordered Crates to enter another.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could permit the beautiful daughter of the honoured Archias to remain
      with Hermon for half an hour, then he must beg her to allow herself to be
      escorted to her home, as the barracks were closed at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved, he
      clasped her hand, pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent
      gratitude, and when he felt her warmly return the pressure, he could not
      restrain the desire to clasp her to his heart. For the first time his lips
      met hers, he confessed his love, and that he had just regarded death as a
      deliverer; but his life was now gaining new charm through her affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Daphne herself threw her arms around his neck with fervent devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love that resistlessly drew his heart to her was returned with equal
      strength and ardour. In spite of his deep mental distress, he could have
      shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude. He might now have been
      permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him
      from the greatest danger, but the confession he must make to his
      fellow-artists in the palaestra the following morning still sealed his
      lips. Yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her, and ought not to
      conceal what awaited him; so, obeying a strong impulse, he exclaimed: &ldquo;You
      know that I love you! Words can not express the strength of my devotion,
      but for that very reason I must do what duty commands before I ask the
      question, &lsquo;Will you join your fate to mine?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you and have loved you always!&rdquo; Daphne exclaimed tenderly. &ldquo;What
      more is needed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Hermon, with drooping head, murmured: &ldquo;To-morrow I shall no longer be
      what I am now. Wait until I have done what duty enjoins; when that is
      accomplished, you shall ask yourself what worth the blind artist still
      possesses who bartered spurious fame for mockery and disgrace in order not
      to become a hypocrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Daphne raised her face to his, asking, &ldquo;So the Demeter is the work of
      Myrtilus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered firmly. &ldquo;It is the work of Myrtilus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my poor, deceived love!&rdquo; cried Daphne, strongly agitated, in a tone
      of the deepest sorrow. &ldquo;What a terrible ordeal again awaits you! It must
      indeed distress me&mdash;and yet Do not misunderstand me! It seems
      nevertheless as if I ought to rejoice, for you and your art have not
      spoken to me even a single moment from this much-lauded work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore,&rdquo; he interrupted with passionate delight, &ldquo;therefore alone
      you withheld the enthusiastic praise with which the others intoxicated me?
      And I, fool, blinded also in mind, could be vexed with you for it! But
      only wait, wait! Soon-to-morrow even&mdash;there will be no one in
      Alexandria who can accuse me of deserting my own honest aspiration, and,
      if the gods will only restore my sight and the ability to use my hands as
      a sculptor, then, girl, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he was interrupted by a loud knocking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time allowed had expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon again warmly embraced Daphne, saying: &ldquo;Then go! Nothing can cloud
      what these brief moments have bestowed. I must remain blind; but you have
      restored the lost sight to my poor darkened soul. To-morrow I shall stand
      in the palaestra before my comrades, and explain to them what a malicious
      accident deceived me, and with me this whole great city. Many will not
      believe me, and even your father will perhaps consider it a disgrace to
      give his arm to his scorned, calumniated nephew to guide him home. Bring
      this before your mind, and everything else that you must accept with it,
      if you consent, when the time arrives, to become mine. Conceal and
      palliate nothing! But should the Lady Thyone speak of the Eumenides who
      pursued me, tell her that they had probably again extended their arms
      toward me, but when I return to-morrow from the palaestra I shall be freed
      from the terrible beings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, he asked to be told quickly how she had happened to come to the
      palace at the right time at so late an hour, and Daphne informed him as
      briefly and modestly as if the hazardous venture which, in strong
      opposition to her retiring, womanly nature, she had undertaken, was a mere
      matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Thyone in her presence heard from Gras that Hermon intended to go to
      Proclus&rsquo;s banquet, she started up in horror, exclaiming, &ldquo;Then the
      unfortunate man is lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, who had long trusted even the gravest secrets to his discreet
      old wife, had informed her of the terrible office the King had confided to
      him. All the male guests of Proclus were to be executed; the women&mdash;the
      Queen at their head&mdash;would be sent into exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Daphne, on her knees, besought the matron to tell her what threatened
      Hermon, and succeeded in persuading her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrified girl, accompanied by Gras, went first to her lover&rsquo;s house
      and, when she did not find him there, hastened to the King&rsquo;s palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Hermon could have seen her with her fluttering hair, dishevelled by the
      night breeze, and checks blanched by excitement and terror, if he had been
      told how she struggled with Thyone, who tried to detain her and lock her
      up before she left her father&rsquo;s house, he would have perceived with still
      prouder joy, had that been possible, what he possessed in the devoted love
      of this true woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grateful and moved by joyous hopes, he informed Daphne of the words of the
      oracle, which had imprinted themselves upon his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, too, quickly retained them, and murmured softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noise and dazzling radiance are hostile to the purer light, Morning and
      day will rise quietly from the starving sand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could the verse mean except that the blind man would regain the power
      to behold the light of clay amid the sands of the silent desert?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it would be well for him to leave Alexandria now, and she
      described how much benefit she had received while hunting from the silence
      of the wilderness, when she had left the noise of the city behind her. But
      before she had quite finished, the knocking at the door was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovers took leave of each other with one last kiss, and the final
      words of the departing girl echoed consolingly in the blind man&rsquo;s heart,
      &ldquo;The more they take from you, the more closely I will cling to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon spent the latter portion of the night rejoicing in the
      consciousness of a great happiness, yet also troubled by the difficult
      task which he could not escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the market place was filling, gray-haired Philippus visited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He desired before the examination, for which every preparation had been
      made, to understand personally the relation of his dead comrade&rsquo;s son to
      the defeated conspiracy, and he soon perceived that Hermon&rsquo;s presence at
      the banquet was due solely to an unlucky accident or in consequence of the
      Queen&rsquo;s desire to win him over to her plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was forced to advise the blind sculptor to leave Alexandria. The
      suspicion that he had been associated with the conspirators was the more
      difficult to refute, because his Uncle Archias had imprudently allowed
      himself to be persuaded by Proclus and Arsinoe to lend the Queen large
      sums, which had undoubtedly been used to promote her abominable plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippus also informed him that he had just come from Archias, whom he
      had earnestly urged to fly as quickly as possible from the persecution
      which was inevitable; for, secure as Hermon&rsquo;s uncle felt in his innocence,
      the receipts for the large sums loaned by him, which had just been found
      in Proclus&rsquo;s possession, would bear witness against him. Envy and ill will
      would also have a share in this affair, and the usually benevolent King
      knew no mercy where crime against his own person was concerned. So Archias
      intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day. Daphne,
      of course, would accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner listened in surprise and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle driven from his secure possessions to distant lands! Daphne
      taken from him, he knew not whither nor for how long a time, after he had
      just been assured of her great love! He himself on the way to expose
      himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city!
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart contracted painfully, and his solicitude about his uncle&rsquo;s fate
      increased when Philippus informed him that the conspirators had been
      arrested at the banquet and, headed by Amyntas, the Rhodian, Chrysippus,
      and Proclus, had perished by the executioner&rsquo;s sword at sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, Althea, and the other ladies were already on the way to Coptos,
      in Upper Egypt, whither the King had exiled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ptolemy had intrusted the execution of this severe punishment to
      Alexander&rsquo;s former comrade as the most trustworthy and discreet of his
      subjects, but rejected, with angry curtness, Philippus&rsquo;s attempt to uphold
      the innocence of his friend Archias.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s conversation with Hermon was interrupted by the
      functionaries who subjected him and Crates to the examination. It lasted a
      long time, and referred to every incident in the artist&rsquo;s life since his
      return to Alexandria. The result was favourable, and the prisoner was
      dismissed from confinement with the learned companion of his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, accompanied by Philippus, Hermon reached his house, it was so late
      that the artists&rsquo; festival in honour of the sculptor Euphranor, who
      entered his seventieth year of life that day, must have already commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way the blind man told the general what a severe trial awaited him,
      and the latter approved his course and, on bidding him farewell, with
      sincere emotion urged Hermon to take courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After hastily strengthening himself with a few mouthfuls of food and a
      draught of wine, his slave Patran, who understood writing, wished to put
      on the full laurel wreath; but Hermon was seized with a painful sense of
      dissatisfaction, and angrily waved it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a single green leaf on his head, he walked, leaning on the
      Egyptian&rsquo;s arm, into the palaestra, which was diagonally opposite to his
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless he longed to hasten at once to Daphne, but he felt that he could
      not take leave of her until he had first cast off, as his heart and mind
      dictated, the terrible burden which oppressed his soul. Besides, he knew
      that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him
      one last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Daphne&rsquo;s image, and what threatened her father, and her with him,
      receded far into the background. He could think only of his design, and
      how he was to execute it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet ought he not to have the laurel wreath put on, in order, after
      removing it, to bestow it on the genius of Myrtilus?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet no!
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he still possess the right to award this noble branch to any one? He
      was appearing before his companions only to give truth its just due. It
      was repulsive to endow this explanation of an unfortunate error with a
      captivating aspect by any theatrical adornment. To be honest, even for the
      porter, was a simple requirement of duty, and no praiseworthy merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guide forced a path for him through carriages, litters, and whole
      throngs of slaves and common people, who had assembled before the
      neighbouring palaestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doorkeepers admitted the blind man, who was well known here, without
      delay; but he called to the slave: &ldquo;Quick, Patran, and not among the
      spectators&mdash;in the centre of the arena!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptian obeyed, and his master crossed the wide space, strewn with
      sand, and approached the stage which had been erected for the festal
      performances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even had his eyes retained the power of sight, his blood was coursing so
      wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to
      distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators, who,
      crowded closely together, richly garlanded, their cheeks glowing with
      enthusiasm, surrounded the arena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hermon!&rdquo; shouted his friend Soteles in joyful surprise in the midst of
      this painful walk. &ldquo;Hermon!&rdquo; resounded here, there, and everywhere as,
      leaning on his friend&rsquo;s arm, he stepped upon the stage, and the
      acclamations grew louder and louder as Soteles fulfilled the sculptor&rsquo;s
      request and led him to the front of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obeying a sign from the director of the festival, the chorus, which had
      just sung a hymn to the Muses, was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the sculptor began to speak, and noisy applause thundered around him
      as he concluded the well-chosen words of homage with which he offered
      cordial congratulations to the estimable Euphranor, to whom the festival
      was given; but the shouts soon ceased, for the audience had heard his
      modest entreaty to be permitted to say a few words, concerning a personal
      matter, to those who were his professional colleagues, as well as to the
      others who had honoured him with their interest and, only too loudly, with
      undeserved applause. The more closely what he had to say concerned
      himself, the briefer he would make his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, he did not long claim the attention of his hearers. Clearly
      and curtly he stated how it had been possible to mistake Mrytilus&rsquo;s work
      for his, how the Tennis goldsmith had dispelled his first suspicion, and
      how vainly he had besought the priests of Demeter to be permitted to feel
      his statue. Then, without entering into details, he informed them that,
      through an accident, he had now reached the firm conviction that he had
      long worn wreaths which belonged to another. But, though the latter could
      not rise from the grave, he still owed it to truth, to whose service he
      had dedicated his art from the beginning, and to the simple honesty, dear
      alike to the peasant and the artist, to divest himself of the fame to
      which he was not entitled. Even while he believed himself to be the
      creator of the Demeter, he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so
      many critics, because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become
      faithless to his art and his nature. In the name of the dead, he thanked
      his dear comrades for the enthusiastic appreciation his masterpiece had
      found. Honour to Myrtilus and his art, but he trusted this noble festal
      assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception, and aid his prayer
      for recovery. If it should be granted he hoped to show that Hermon had not
      been wholly unworthy to adorn himself for a short time with the wreaths of
      Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he closed, deep silence reigned for a brief interval, and one man
      looked at another irresolutely until the hero of the day, gray-haired
      Euphranor, rose and, leaning on the arm of his favourite pupil, walked
      through the centre of the arena to the stage, mounted it, embraced Hermon
      with paternal warmth, and made him happy by the words: &ldquo;The deception that
      has fallen to your lot, my poor young friend, is a lamentable one; but
      honour to every one who honestly means to uphold the truth. We will
      beseech the immortals with prayers and sacrifices to restore sight to your
      artist eyes. If I am permitted, my dear young comrade, to see you continue
      to create, it will be a source of joy to me and all of us; yet the Muses,
      even though unasked, lead into the eternal realm of beauty the elect who
      consecrates his art to truth with the right earnestness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The embrace with which the venerable hero of the festival seemed to
      absolve Hermon was greeted with loud applause; but the kind words which
      Euphranor, in the weak voice of age, had addressed to the blind man had
      been unintelligible to the large circle of guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he again descended to the arena new plaudits rose; but soon hisses
      and other signs of disapproval blended with them, which increased in
      strength and number when a well known critic, who had written a learned
      treatise concerning the relation of the Demeter to Hermon&rsquo;s earlier works,
      expressed his annoyance in a loud whistle. The dissatisfied and
      disappointed spectators now vied with one another to silence those who
      were cheering by a hideous uproar while the latter expressed more and more
      loud the sincere esteem with which they were inspired by the confession of
      the artist who, though cruelly prevented from winning fresh fame, cast
      aside the wreath which a dead man had, as were, proffered from his tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably every man thought that, in the same situation, he would have done
      the same yet not only justice&mdash;nay, compassion&mdash;dictated showing
      the blind artist that they believed in and would sustain him. The
      ill-disposed insisted that Hermon had only done what duty commanded the
      meanest man, and the fact that he had deceived all Alexandria still
      remained. Not a few joined this party, for larger possession excite envy
      perhaps even more frequently than greater fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the approving and opposing voices mingled in an actual conflict. But
      before the famous sculptor Chares, the great and venerable artist Nicias,
      and several younger friends of Hermon quelled this unpleasant disturbance
      of the beautiful festival, the blind man, leaning on the arm of his
      fellow-artist Soteles, had left the palaestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the exit he, parted from his friend, who had been made happy by the
      ability to absolve his more distinguished leader from the reproach of
      having become faithless to their common purpose, and who intended to
      intercede further in his behalf in the palaestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon no longer needed him; for, besides his slave Patran, he found the
      steward Gras, who, by his master&rsquo;s order, guided the blind man to
      Archias&rsquo;s closed harmamaxa, which was waiting outside the building.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sculptor&rsquo;s head was burning feverishly when he entered the vehicle. He
      had never imagined that the consequences of his explanation would be so
      terrible. During the drive&mdash;by no means a long one&mdash;to the great
      harbour, he strove to collect his thoughts. Groaning aloud, he covered his
      ears with his hands to shut out the shouts and hisses from the palaestra,
      which in reality were no longer audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, he would not need to expose himself to this uproar a second time,
      yet if he remained in Alexandria the witticisms, mockery, and jibes of the
      whole city, though in a gentler form, would echo hundreds of times around
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must leave the city. He would have preferred to go on board the staunch
      Tacheia and be borne far away with his uncle and Daphne, but he was
      obliged to deny himself the fulfilment of this desire. He must now think
      solely of regaining his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obedient to the oracle, he would go to the desert where from the &ldquo;starving
      sand&rdquo; the radiant daylight was to rise anew for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he would, at any rate, be permitted to recover the clearness of
      perception and feeling which he had lost in the delirium of the dissolute
      life of pleasure that he had led in the past. Pythagoras had already
      forbidden the folly of spoiling the present by remorse; and he, too, did
      not do this. It would have been repugnant to his genuinely Greek nature.
      Instead of looking backward with peevish regret, his purpose was to look
      with blithe confidence toward the future, and to do his best to render it
      better and more fruitful than the months of revel which lay behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could no longer imagine a life worth living without Daphne, and the
      thought that if his uncle were robbed of his wealth he would become her
      support cheered his heart. If the oracle did not fulfil its promise, he
      would again appeal to medical skill, and submit even to the most severe
      suffering which might be imposed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive to the great harbour was soon over, but the boat which lay
      waiting for him had a considerable distance to traverse, for the Tacheia
      was no longer at the landing place, but was tacking outside the Pharos, in
      order, if the warrant of arrest were issued, not to be stopped at the
      channel dominated by the lighthouse. He found the slender trireme pervaded
      by a restless stir. His uncle had long been expecting him with burning
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, through Philippus, what duty still detained the deceived artist,
      but he learned, at the same time, that his own imprisonment had been
      determined, and it would be advisable for him to leave the city behind him
      as quickly as possible. Yet neither Daphne nor he was willing to depart
      without saying farewell to Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the danger was increasing every moment, and, warm as was the parting,
      the last clasp of the hand and kiss swiftly followed the first words of
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the blind artist learned only that Archias was going to the island of
      Lesbos, his mother&rsquo;s home, and that he had promised his daughter to give
      Hermon time to recover his sight. The property bequeathed to him by
      Myrtilus had been placed by the merchant in the royal bank, and he had
      also protected himself against any chance of poverty. Hermon was to send
      news of his health to Lesbos from time to time if a safe opportunity
      offered and, when Daphne knew where he was to be found, she could let him
      have tidings. Of course, for the present great caution must be exercised
      in order not to betray the abode of the fugitives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon, too, ought to evade the pursuit of the incensed King as quickly as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only Daphne&rsquo;s eyes, but her father&rsquo;s also, overflowed with tears at
      this parting, and Hermon perceived more plainly than ever that he was as
      dear to his uncle as though he were his own son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low words which the artist exchanged with the woman whose love, even
      during the period of separation, would shed light and warmth upon his
      darkened life, were deeply impressed upon the souls of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the present, faithful Gras was to remain in charge of his master&rsquo;s
      house in Alexandria. Leaning on his arm, the blind man left the Tacheia,
      which, as soon as both had entered the boat, was urged forward by powerful
      strokes of the oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bithynian informed Hermon that kerchiefs were waving him a farewell
      from the trireme, that the sails had been unfurled, and the wind was
      driving the swift vessel before it like a swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Pharos Gras reported that a royal galley was just passing them,
      undoubtedly in pursuit of the Tacheia; but the latter was the swiftest of
      all the Greek vessels, and they need not fear that she would be overtaken
      by the war ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sore heart and the desolate feeling of being now utterly alone,
      Hermon again landed and ordered that his uncle&rsquo;s harmamaxa should convey
      him to the necropolis. He desired to seek peace at his mother&rsquo;s grave, and
      to take leave of these beloved tombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guided by the steward, he left them cheered and with fresh confidence in
      the future, and the faithful servant&rsquo;s account of the energy with which
      Daphne had aided the preparations for departure benefited him like a
      refreshing bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was again at home, one visitor after another was announced, who
      came there from the festival in the palaestra, and, in spite of his great
      reluctance to receive them, he denied no one admittance, but listened even
      to the ill-disposed and spiteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the battle which he had commenced he must not shrink from wounds, and
      he was struck by many a poisoned shaft. But, to make amends, a clear
      understanding was effected between him and those whom he esteemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last caller left him just before midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon now made many preparations for departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He intended to go into the desert with very little luggage, as the oracle
      seemed to direct. How long a time his absence would extend could not be
      estimated, and the many poor people whom he had fed and supported must not
      suffer through his departure. The arrangements required to effect this he
      dictated to the slave, who understood writing. He had gained in him an
      extremely capable servant, and Patran expressed his readiness to follow
      him into the desert; but the wry face which, sure that the blind man could
      not see him, he made while saying so, seemed to prove the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary, and yet too excited to find sleep, Hermon at last went to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      If his Myrtilus had been with him now, what would he not have had to say
      to express his gratitude, to explain! How overjoyed he would have been at
      the fulfilment of his wish to see him united to Daphne, at least in heart;
      with what fiery ardour he would have upbraided those who believed him
      capable of having appropriated what belonged to another!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Myrtilus was no more, and who could tell whether his body had not
      remained unburied, and his soul was therefore condemned to be borne
      restlessly between heaven and earth, like a leaf driven by the wind? Yet,
      if the earth covered him, where was the spot on which sacrifices could be
      offered to his soul, his tombstone could be anointed, and he himself
      remembered?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a doubt which had never before entered his mind suddenly took
      possession of Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since for so many months he had firmly believed his friend&rsquo;s work to be
      his own, he might also have fallen into another delusion, and Myrtilus
      might still dwell among the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this thought the blind man, with a swift movement, sat erect upon his
      couch; it seemed as if a bright light blazed before his eyes in the dark
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasons which had led the authorities to pronounce Myrtilus dead
      rendered his early end probable, it is true, yet by no means proved it
      absolutely. He must hold fast to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who, ever since he returned to Alexandria from Tennis, had squandered
      precious time as if possessed by evil demons, would now make a better use
      of it. Besides, he longed to leave the capital. What! Suppose he should
      now, even though it were necessary to delay obeying the oracle&rsquo;s command,
      search, traverse, sail through the world in pursuit of Myrtilus, even, if
      it must be, to the uttermost Thule?
    </p>
    <p>
      But he fell back upon the couch as quickly as he had started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blind! blind!&rdquo; he groaned in dull despair. How could he, who was not able
      even to see his hand before his eyes, succeed in finding his friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, yet&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had his mind been darkened with his eyes, that this thought came to him
      now for the first time, that he had not sent messengers to all quarters of
      the globe to find some trace of the assailants and, with them, of the lost
      man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was Ledscha who had him in her power, and, while he was
      pondering and forming plans for the best way of conducting investigations,
      the dimmed image of the Biamite again returned distinctly to his mind, and
      with it that of Arachne and the spider, into which the goddess transformed
      the weaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half overcome by sleep, he saw himself, staff in hand, led by Daphne,
      cross green meadows and deserts, valleys and mountains, to seek his
      friend; yet whenever he fancied he caught sight of him, and Ledscha with
      him, in the distance, the spider descended from above and, with magical
      speed, wove a net which concealed both from his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Groaning and deeply disturbed, half awake, he struggled onward, always
      toward one goal, to find his Myrtilus again, when suddenly the sound of
      the knocker on the entrance door and the barking of Lycas, his Arabian
      greyhound, shook the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recalled to waking life, he started up and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the men who were to arrest him or inquisitive visitors not allowed
      themselves to be deterred even by the late hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened angrily as the old porter sternly accosted the late guest;
      but, directly after, the gray-haired native of the region near the First
      Cataract burst into the strange Nubian oaths which he lavished liberally
      whenever anything stirred his aged soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog, which Hermon had owned only a few months, continued to bark; but
      above his hostile baying the blind man thought he recognised a name at
      whose sound the blood surged hotly into his cheeks. Yet he could scarcely
      have heard aright!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he sprang from the couch, groped his way to the door, opened it, and
      entered the impluvium that adjoined his bedroom. The cool night air blew
      upon him from the open ceiling. A strong draught showed that the door
      leading from the atrium was being opened, and now a shout, half choked by
      weeping, greeted him: &ldquo;Hermon! My clear, my poor beloved master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bias, faithful Bias!&rdquo; fell from the blind man&rsquo;s lips, and when he felt
      the returned slave sink down before him, cover his hand with kisses and
      wet it with tears, he raised him in his strong arms, clasped him in a warm
      embrace, kissed his checks, and gasped, &ldquo;And Myrtilus, my Myrtilus, is he
      alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; sobbed Bias. &ldquo;But you, my lord-blind, blind! Can it be
      true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Hermon released him to inquire again about his friend, Bias
      stammered: &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t faring so badly; but you, you, bereft of light and
      also of the joy of seeing your faithful Bias again! And the immortals
      prolong one&rsquo;s years to experience such evils! Two griefs always belong to
      one joy, like two horses to a chariot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wise Bias! Just as you were of old!&rdquo; cried Hermon in joyful
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he quieted the hound and ordered one of the attendants, who came
      hurrying in, to bring out whatever dainty viands the house contained and a
      jar of the best Byblus wine from the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he did not cease his inquiries about his friend&rsquo;s health, and
      ordered a goblet to be brought him also, that he might pledge the slave
      and give brief answers to his sympathizing questions about the cause of
      the blindness, the noble Archias, the gracious young mistress Daphne, the
      famous Philippus and his wife, the companion Chrysilla, and the steward
      Gras. Amid all this he resolved to free the faithful fellow and, while
      Bias was eating, he could not refrain from telling him that he had found a
      mistress for him, that Daphne was the wife whom he had chosen, but the
      wedding was still a long way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He controlled his impatience to learn the particulars concerning his
      friend&rsquo;s fate until Bias had partially satisfied his hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time ago Hermon would have declared it impossible that he could
      ever become so happy during this period of conflict and separation from
      the object of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of his lost inheritance doubtless flitted through his mind,
      but it seemed merely like worthless dust, and the certainty that Myrtilus
      still walked among the living filled him with unclouded happiness. Even
      though he could no longer see him, he might expect to hear his beloved
      voice again. Oh, what delight that he was permitted to have his friend
      once more, as well as Daphne, that he could meet him so freely and
      joyously and keep the laurel, which had rested with such leaden weight
      upon his head, for Myrtilus, and for him alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the name of the miracle which had saved him, and yet kept him
      away from his embrace so long?
    </p>
    <p>
      How had Myrtilus and Bias escaped the flames and death on that night of
      horror?
    </p>
    <p>
      A flood of questions assailed the slave before he could begin a connected
      account, and Hermon constantly interrupted it to ask for details
      concerning his friend and his health at each period and on every occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much surprised by his discreet manner, the artist listened to the
      bondman&rsquo;s narrative; for though Bias had formerly allowed himself to
      indulge in various little familiarities toward his master, he refrained
      from them entirely in this story, and the blind man&rsquo;s misfortune invested
      him in his eyes with a peculiar sacredness.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      He had arrived wounded on the pirate ship with his master&rsquo;s friend, the
      returned bondman began. When he had regained consciousness, he met Ledscha
      on board the Hydra, as the wife of the pirate Hanno. She had nursed
      Myrtilus with tireless solicitude, and also often cared for his, Bias&rsquo;s,
      wounds. After the recovery of the prisoners, she became their protectress,
      and placed Bias in the service of the Greek artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      They, the Gaul Lutarius, and one of the sculptor&rsquo;s slaves, were the only
      ones who had been brought on board the Hydra alive from the attack in
      Tennis, but the latter soon succumbed to his wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon owed it solely to the bridge-builder that he had escaped from the
      vengeance of his Biamite foe, for the tall Gaul, whose thick beard
      resembled Hermon&rsquo;s in length and blackness, was mistaken by Hanno for the
      person whom Ledscha had directed him to deliver alive into her power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirate had surrendered the wrong captive to the woman he loved and, as
      Bias declared, to his serious disadvantage; for, though Hanno and the
      Biamite girl were husband and wife, no one could help perceiving the cold
      dislike with which Ledscha rebuffed the giant who read her every wish in
      her eyes. Finally, the captain of the pirate ship, a silent man by nature,
      often did not open his lips for days except to give orders to the crew.
      Frequently he even refused to be relieved from duty, and remained all
      night at the helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when, at his own risk, or with the vessels of his father and brother,
      he attacked merchant ships or defended himself against a war galley, did
      he wake to vigorous life and rush with gallant recklessness into battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single man on the Hydra was little inferior to him in strength and
      daring&mdash;the Gaul Lutarius. He had been enrolled among the pirates,
      and when Hanno was wounded in an engagement with a Syrian war galley, was
      elected his representative. During this time Ledscha faithfully performed
      her duty as her young husband&rsquo;s nurse, but afterward treated him as coldly
      as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she devoted herself eagerly to the ship and the crew, and the fierce,
      lawless fellows cheerfully submitted to the sensible arrangements of their
      captain&rsquo;s beautiful, energetic wife. At this period Bias had often met
      Ledscha engaged in secret conversation with the Gaul, yet if any tender
      emotion really attracted her toward any one other than her husband,
      Myrtilus would have been suspected rather than the black-bearded
      bridge-builder; for she not only showed the sculptor the kindest
      consideration, but often entered into conversation with him, and even
      persuaded him, when the sea was calm, or the Hydra lay at anchor in one of
      the hidden bays known to the pirates, to practise his art, and at last to
      make a bust of her. She had succeeded in getting him clay, wax, and tools
      for the purpose. After asking which goddess had ill-treated the weaver
      Arachne, she commanded him to make a head of Athene, adorned with the
      helmet, modelled from her own. During this time she frequently inquired
      whether her features really were not beautiful enough to be copied for the
      countenance of a goddess, and when he eagerly assured her of the fact,
      made him swear that he was not deceiving her with flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Bias nor Myrtilus had ever been allowed to remain on shore; but,
      on the whole, the slave protested, Myrtilus&rsquo;s health, thanks to the pure
      sea air on the Hydra, had improved, in spite of the longing which often
      assailed him, and the great excitements to which he was sometimes exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been anxious hours when Hanno&rsquo;s father and brothers visited the
      Hydra to induce her captain to make money out of the captive sculptor, and
      either sell him at a high price or extort a large ransom from him; but
      Bias had overheard how resolutely Ledscha opposed these proposals, and
      represented to old Satabus of what priceless importance Myrtilus might
      become to them if either should be captured and imprisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest excitements, of course, had been connected with the battles
      of the pirates. Myrtilus, who, in spite of his feeble health, by no means
      lacked courage, found it especially hard to bear that during the conflicts
      he was locked up with Bias, but even Ledscha could neither prevent nor
      restrict these measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias could not tell what seas the Hydra had sailed, nor at what&mdash;usually
      desolate-shores she had touched. He only knew that she had gone to Sinope
      in Pontus, passed through the Propontis, and then sought booty near the
      coasts of Asia Minor. Ledscha had refused to answer every question that
      referred to these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Latterly, the young wife had become very grave, and apparently completely
      severed her relations with her husband; but she also studiously avoided
      the Gaul and, if they talked to each other at all, it was in hurried
      whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So events went on until something occurred which was to affect the lives
      of the prisoners deeply. It must have been just beyond the outlet from the
      Hellespont into the AEgean Sea; for, in order to pass through the narrow
      straits leading thither from Pontus, the Hydra had been most skilfully
      given the appearance of a peaceful merchant vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slave&rsquo;s soul must have been greatly agitated by this experience, for
      while, hitherto, whenever he was interrupted by Hermon he had retained his
      composure, and could not refrain from occasionally connecting a practical
      application with his report, now, mastered by the power of the
      remembrance, he uttered what he wished to tell his master in an oppressed
      tone, while bright drops of perspiration bedewed the speaker&rsquo;s brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large merchant ship had approached them, and three men came on board the
      Hydra&mdash;old Satabus, his son Labaja, and a gray-haired, bearded
      seafarer of tall stature and dignified bearing, Schalit, Ledscha&rsquo;s father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting between the Biamite ship-owner and his child, after so long a
      separation, was a singular one; for the young wife held out her hand to
      her father timidly, with downcast eyes, and he refused to take it.
      Directly after, however, as if constrained by an irresistible impulse, he
      drew his unruly daughter toward him and kissed her brow and cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roast meat and the best wine had been served in the large ship&rsquo;s cabin;
      but though Myrtilus and Bias had been locked up as if a bloody battle was
      expected, the loud, angry uproar of men&rsquo;s deep voices reached them, and
      Ledscha&rsquo;s shrill tones shrieking in passionate wrath blended in the
      strife. Furniture must have been upset and dishes broken, yet the giants
      who were disputing here did not come to blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the savage turmoil subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bias and his master were again released, Ledscha was standing, in the
      dusk of evening, at the foot of the mainmast, pressing her brow against
      the wood as if she needed some support to save herself from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She checked Myrtilus&rsquo;s words with an imperious &ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; The next
      day she had paced restlessly up and down the deck like a caged beast of
      prey, and would permit no one to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon Hanno was about to get into a boat to go to her father&rsquo;s ship, and
      she insisted upon accompanying him. But this time the corsair seemed
      completely transformed, and with the pitiless sternness, which he so well
      knew how to use in issuing commands, ordered her to remain on the Hydra.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, however, by no means obeyed her husband&rsquo;s mandate without resistance,
      and, at the recollection of the conflict which now occurred between the
      pair, in which she raged like a tigress, the narrator&rsquo;s cheeks crimsoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarrel was ended by the powerful seaman&rsquo;s taking in his arms his
      lithe, slender wife, who resisted him with all her strength and had
      already touched the side of the boat with her foot, and putting her down
      on the deck of his ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hanno leaped back into the skiff, while Ledscha, groaning with rage,
      retired to the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after she again appeared on deck, called Myrtilus and Bias and,
      showing them her eyes, reddened by tears, told them, as if in apology for
      her weakness, that she had not been permitted to bid her father farewell.
      Then, pallid as a corpse, she had turned the conversation upon Hermon, and
      informed Myrtilus that an Alexandrian pilot had told her father that he
      was blind, and her brother-in-law Labaja had heard the same thing. While
      saying this, her lips curled scornfully, but when she saw how deeply their
      friend&rsquo;s misfortune moved her two prisoners, she waved her hand, declaring
      that he did not need their sympathy; the pilot had reported that he was
      living in magnificence and pleasure, and the people in the capital
      honoured and praised him as if he were a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she had laughed shrilly and reviled so bitterly the contemptible
      blind Fortune that remains most loyal to those who deserve to perish in
      the deepest misery, that Bias avoided repeating her words to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of Myrtilus&rsquo;s legacy had not reached her ears, and Bias, too, had
      just heard of it for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha&rsquo;s object had been to relieve her troubled soul by attacks upon the
      man whom she hated, but she suddenly turned to the master and servant to
      ask if they desired to obtain their liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how quickly a hopeful &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; reached the ears of the gloomy woman! how
      ready both were to swear, by a solemn oath, to fulfil the conditions the
      Biamite desired to impose!
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as opportunity offered, both were to leave the Hydra with one
      other person who, like Bias and herself, understood how to mange a boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The favourable moment soon came. One moonless night, when the steering of
      the Hydra was intrusted to the Gaul, Ledscha waked the two prisoners and,
      with the Gaul Lutarius, Myrtilus, and the slave, entered the boat, which
      conveyed them to the shore without accident or interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias knew the name of the place where it had anchored, it is true, but the
      oath which Ledscha had made him swear there was so terrible that he would
      not have broken it at any cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      This oath required the slave, who, three days after their landing, was
      sent to Alexandria by the first ship that sailed for that port, to
      maintain the most absolute secrecy concerning Myrtilus&rsquo;s hiding place
      until he was authorized to speak. Bias was to go to Alexandria without
      delay, and there obtain from Archias, who managed Myrtilus&rsquo;s property, the
      sums which Ledscha intended to use in the following manner: Two attic
      talents Bias was to bring back. These were for the Gaul, probably in
      payment for his assistance. Two more were to be taken by the slave to the
      Temple of Nemesis. Lastly, Bias was to deliver five talents to old Tabus,
      who kept the treasure of the pirate family on the Owl&rsquo;s Nest, and tell her
      that Ledscha, in this money, sent back the bridal dowry which Hanno had
      paid her father for his daughter. With this she released herself from the
      husband who inspired her with feelings very unlike love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon asked to have this commission repeated, and received the directions
      Myrtilus had given to the slave. The blind man&rsquo;s hope that they must also
      include greetings and news from his friend&rsquo;s hand was destroyed by Bias,
      whom Myrtilus, in the leisure hours on the Hydra, had taught to read. This
      was not so difficult a task for the slave, who longed for knowledge, and
      had already tried it before. But with writing, on the other hand, he could
      make no headway. He was too old, and his hand had become too clumsy to
      acquire this difficult art.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to Hermon&rsquo;s anxious question whether his friend needed anything
      in his present abode, the slave reported that he was at liberty to move
      about at will, and was not even obliged to share Ledscha&rsquo;s lodgings. He
      lacked nothing, for the Biamite, besides some gold, had left with him also
      gems and pearls of such great value that they would suffice to support him
      several years. As for himself, she had supplied him more than abundantly
      with money for travelling expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myrtilus was awaiting his return in a city prospering under a rich and
      wise regent, and sent whole cargoes of affectionate remembrances. The
      sculptor, too, was firmly resolved to keep the oath imposed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he, Bias, had performed the commission intrusted to him, he and
      Myrtilus would be released from their vow, and Hermon would learn his
      friend&rsquo;s residence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      No morning brightened Hermon&rsquo;s night of darkness.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the returned slave had finished his report, the sun was already
      shining into his master&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without lying down again, the latter went at once to the Tennis notary,
      who had moved to Alexandria two months before, and with his assistance
      raised the money which his friend needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worthy Melampus had received the news that Myrtilus was still alive in a
      very singular manner. Even now he could grasp only one thing at a time,
      and he loved Hermon with sincere devotion. Therefore the lawyer who had so
      zealously striven to expedite the blind man&rsquo;s entering into possession of
      his friend&rsquo;s inheritance would very willingly have permitted Myrtilus&mdash;doubtless
      an invalid&mdash;to continue to rest quietly among the dead. Yet his kind
      heart rejoiced at the deliverance of the famous young artist, and so
      during Hermon&rsquo;s story he had passed from sincere regret to loud
      expressions of joyous sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, he had placed his whole property at the disposal of Hermon, who
      had paid him liberally for his work, to provide for the blind sculptor&rsquo;s
      future. This generous offer had been declined; but he now assisted Hermon
      to prepare the emancipation papers for his faithful Bias, and found a ship
      that was bound to Tanis. Toward evening he accompanied Hermon to the
      harbour and, after a cordial farewell from his helpful friend, the artist,
      with the new &ldquo;freedman&rdquo; Bias and the slave clerk Patran, went on board the
      vessel, now ready to sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyage was one of the speediest, yet the end came too soon for both
      master and servant&mdash;Hermon had not yet heard enough of the friend
      beyond his reach, and Bias was far from having related everything he
      desired to tell about Myrtilus and Ledscha; yet he was now permitted to
      express every opinion that entered his mind, and this had occupied a great
      deal of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias also sought to know much more about Hermon&rsquo;s past and future than he
      had yet learned, not merely from curiosity, but because he foresaw that
      Myrtilus would not cease to question him about his blind friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The misfortune must have produced a deep and lasting effect upon the
      artist&rsquo;s joyous nature, for his whole bearing was pervaded by such
      earnestness and dignity that years, instead of months, seemed to have
      elapsed since their separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of Daphne that her lover&rsquo;s blindness did not
      alienate her from him; yet why had not the girl, who still desired to
      become his wife, been able to wed the helpless man who had lost his sight?
      If the father did not wish to be separated from his daughter, surely he
      could live with the young couple. A home was quickly made everywhere for
      the rich, and, if Archias was tired of his house in Alexandria, as Hermon
      had intimated, there was room enough in the world for a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was the way with things here below! Man was the cause of man&rsquo;s
      misfortune! Daphne and Hermon remained the same; but Archias from an
      affectionate father had become transformed into an entirely different
      person. If the former had been allowed to follow their inclinations, they
      would now be united and happy, while, because a third person so willed,
      they must go their way solitary and wretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      He expressed this view to his master, and insisted upon his opinion until
      Hermon confided to him what had driven Archias from Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patran, Bias&rsquo;s successor, was by no means satisfactory to him. Had Hermon
      retained his sight, he certainly would not have purchased him, in spite of
      his skill as a scribe, for the Egyptian had a &ldquo;bad face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if only he could have been permitted to stay with his benefactor
      instead of this sullen man! How carefully he would have removed the stones
      from his darkened pathway!
    </p>
    <p>
      During the voyage he was obliged to undergo severe struggles to keep the
      oath of secrecy imposed upon him; but perjury threatened him with the most
      horrible tortures, not to mention the sorceress Tabus, whom he was to
      meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Myrtilus&rsquo;s abode remained unknown to Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias approved his master&rsquo;s intention of going into the desert. He had
      often seen the oracle of Amon tested, and he himself had experienced the
      healthfulness of the desert air. Besides, it made him proud to see that
      Hermon was disposed to follow his suggestion of pitching his tent in a
      spot which he designated. This was at the end of the arm of the sea at
      Clysma. Several trees grew there beside small springs, and a peaceful
      family of Amalekites raised vegetables in their little garden, situated on
      higher ground, watered by the desert wells.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a boy, before the doom of slavery had been pronounced upon him and
      his father, his mother, by the priest&rsquo;s advice, took him there to recover
      from the severe attack of fever which he could not shake off amid the damp
      papyrus plantations surrounding his parents&rsquo; house. In the dry, pure air
      of the desert he recovered, and he would guide Hermon there before
      returning to Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Tanis they reached Tennis in a few hours, and found shelter in the
      home of the superintendent of Archias&rsquo;s weaving establishments, whose
      hospitality Myrtilus and Hermon had enjoyed before their installation in
      the white house, now burned to the ground. The Alexandrian bills of
      exchange were paid in gold by the lessee of the royal bank, who was a good
      friend of Hermon. Toward evening, both rowed to the Owl&rsquo;s Nest, taking the
      five talents with which the runaway wife intended to purchase freedom from
      her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the men approached the central door of the pirates&rsquo; house, a middy-aged
      Biamite woman appeared and rudely ordered them to leave the island. Tabus
      was weak, and refused to see visitors. But she was mistaken; for when
      Bias, in the dialect of his tribe, shouted loudly that messengers from the
      wife of her grandson Hanno had arrived, there was a movement at the back
      of the room, and broken sentences, gasped with difficulty, expressed the
      old dame&rsquo;s wish to receive the strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sheep&rsquo;s-wool couch, over which was spread a wolfskin, the last gift
      of her son Satabus, lay the sorceress, who raised herself as Hermon passed
      through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his greeting, she pointed to her deaf ear and begged him to speak
      louder. At the same time she gazed into his eyes with a keen, penetrating
      glance, and interrupted him by the question: &ldquo;The Greek sculptor whose
      studio was burned over his head? And blind? Blind still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In both eyes,&rdquo; Bias answered for his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, fellow?&rdquo; the old dame asked; then, recollecting herself, stopped
      the reply on the servant&rsquo;s lips with the hasty remark: &ldquo;You are the
      blackbeard&rsquo;s slave&mdash;a Biamite? Oh, I remember perfectly! You
      disappeared with the burning house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she gazed intently and thoughtfully from one to the other, and at
      last, pointing to Bias, muttered in a whisper: &ldquo;You alone come from Hanno
      and Ledscha, and were with them on the Hydra? Very well. What news have
      you for the old woman from the young couple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The freedman began to relate what brought him to the Owl&rsquo;s Nest, and the
      gray-haired crone listened eagerly until he said that Ledscha lived
      unhappily with her husband, and therefore had left him. She sent back to
      her, as the head of Hanno&rsquo;s family, the bridal dowry with which Hanno had
      bought her from her father as his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tabus struggled into a little more erect posture, and asked: &ldquo;What
      does this mean? Five talents&mdash;and gold, not silver talents? And she
      sends the money to me? To me? And she ran away from her husband? But no&mdash;no!
      Once more&mdash;you are a Biamite&mdash;repeat it in our own language&mdash;and
      loudly. This ear is the better one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bias obeyed, and the old dame listened to the end without interrupting
      him: then raising her brown right hand, covered with a network of
      blue-black veins, she clinched it into a fist, which she shook far more
      violently than Bias would have believed possible in her weak condition. At
      the same time she pressed her lips so tightly together that her toothless
      mouth deepened into a hole, and her dim eyes shone with a keen, menacing
      light. For some time she found no reply, though strange, rattling, gasping
      sounds escaped her heaving breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she succeeded in uttering words, and shrieked shrilly: &ldquo;This&mdash;this&mdash;away
      with the golden trash! With the bridal dowry of the family rejected, and
      once more free, the base fool thinks she would be like the captive fox
      that gnawed the rope! Oh, this age, these people! And this, this is the
      haughty, strong Ledscha, the daughter of the Biamites, who&mdash;there
      stands the blind girl&mdash;deceiver!&mdash;who so admirably avenged
      herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here her voice failed, and Hermon began to speak to assure her that she
      understood Ledscha&rsquo;s wish aright. Then he asked her for a token by which
      she acknowledged the receipt of the gold, which he handed her in a stout
      linen bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his purpose was not fulfilled, for suddenly, flaming with passionate
      wrath, she thrust the purse aside, groaning: &ldquo;Not an obol of the accursed
      destruction of souls shall come back to Hanno, nor even into the family
      store. Until his heart and hers stop beating, the most indissoluble bond
      will unite both. She desires to ransom herself from a lawful marriage
      concluded by her father, as if she were a captive of war; perhaps she even
      wants to follow another. Hanno, brave lad, was ready to go to death for
      her sake, and she rewards him by bringing shame on his head and disgrace
      on us all. Oh, these times, this world! Everything that is inviolable and
      holy trampled in the dust! But they are not all so! In spite of Grecian
      infidelity, marriage is still honoured among our people. But she who mocks
      what is sacred, and tramples holy customs under foot, shall be accursed,
      execrated, given over to want, hunger, disease, death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With rattling breath and closed eyes she leaned farther back against the
      cushions that supported her; but Bias, in their common language, tried to
      soothe her, and informed her that, though Ledscha had probably run away
      from her husband, she had by no means renounced her vengeance. He was
      bringing two talents with him to place in the Temple of Nemesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Nemesis?&rdquo; repeated the old dame. Then she tried to raise herself and,
      as she constantly sank back again, Bias aided her. But she had scarcely
      recovered her sitting posture when she gasped to the freedman: &ldquo;Nemesis,
      who helped, and is to continue to help her to destroy her foe? Well, well!
      Five talents&mdash;a great sum, a great sum! But the more the better! To
      Nemesis with them, to Ate and the Erinyes! The talons of the avenging
      goddess shall tear the beautiful face, the heart, and the liver of the
      accursed one! A twofold malediction on her who has wronged the son of my
      Satabus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, her head nodded swiftly up and down, and when at last she
      bowed it wearily, her visitors heard her murmur the names of Satabus and
      Hanno, sometimes tenderly, sometimes mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally she asked whether any one else was concerned in Ledscha&rsquo;s flight;
      and when she learned that a Gallic bridge-builder accompanied the fugitive
      wife, she again started up as if frantic, exclaiming: &ldquo;Yes, to Nemesis
      with the gold! We neither need nor want it, and Satabus, my son, he will
      bless me for renunciation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here exhaustion again silenced her. She gazed mutely and thoughtfully into
      vacancy, until at last, turning to Bias, she began more calmly: &ldquo;You will
      see her again, man, and must tell her what the clan of Tabus bought with
      her talents. Take her my curse, and let her know that her friends would be
      my foes, and her foes should find in Tabus a benefactress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, deeply buried in thought, she again fixed her eyes on the floor; but
      at last she called to Hermon, saying: &ldquo;You, blind Greek&mdash;am I not
      right?&mdash;the torch was thrust into your face, and you lost the sight
      of both eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The artist assented to this question; but she bade him sit down before
      her, and when he bent his face near her she raised one lid after the other
      with trembling fingers, yet lightly and skilfully, gazed long and intently
      into his eyes, and murmured: &ldquo;Like black Psoti and lawless Simeon, and
      they are both cured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you restore me?&rdquo; Hermon now asked in great excitement. &ldquo;Answer me
      honestly, you experienced woman! Give me back my sight, and demand
      whatever gold and valuables I still possess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep them,&rdquo; Tabus contemptuously interrupted. &ldquo;Not for gold or goods will
      I restore you the best gift man can lose. I will cure you because you are
      the person to whom the infamous wretch most ardently wished the sorest
      trouble. When she hoped to destroy you, she perceived in this deed the
      happiness which had been promised to her on a night when the full moon was
      shining. To-day&mdash;this very night&mdash;the disk between Astarte&rsquo;s
      horns rounds again, and presently&mdash;wait a little while!&mdash;presently
      you shall have what the light restores you&mdash;&rdquo; Then she called the
      Biamite woman, ordered her to bring the medicine chest, and took from it
      one vessel after another. The box she was seeking was among the last and,
      while handing it to Bias, she muttered: &ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly&mdash;it does
      one good to destroy a foe, but no less to make her foe happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the freedman, she went on in a louder tone: &ldquo;You, slave, shall
      inform Hanno&rsquo;s wife that old Tabus gave the sculptor, whose blindness she
      caused, the remedy which restored the sight of black Psoti, whom she
      knew.&rdquo; Here she paused, gazed upward, and murmured almost unintelligibly:
      &ldquo;Satabus, Hanno! If this is the last act of the old mother, it will give
      ye pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she told Hermon to kneel again, and ordered the slave to hold the
      lamp which her nurse Tasia had just lighted at the hearth fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last,&rdquo; she said, looking into the box, &ldquo;but it will be enough. The
      odour of the herb in the salve is as strong as if it had been prepared
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid the first bandage on Hermon&rsquo;s eyes with her own weak fingers, at
      the same time muttering an incantation; but it did not seem to satisfy
      her. Great excitement had taken possession of her, and as the silver light
      of the full moon shone into her room she waved her hands before the
      artist&rsquo;s eyes and fixed her gaze upon the threshold illumined by the
      moonbeams, ejaculating sentences incomprehensible to the blind man. Bias
      supported her, for she had risen to her full height, and he felt how she
      tottered and trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet her strength held out to whisper to Hermon: &ldquo;Nearer, still nearer! By
      the light of the august one whose rays greet us, let it be said: You will
      see again. Await your recovery patiently in a quiet place in the pure air,
      not in the city. Refrain from everything with which the Greeks intoxicate
      themselves. Shun wine, and whatever heats the blood. Recovery is coming; I
      see it drawing near. You will see again as surely as I now curse the woman
      who abandoned the husband to whom she vowed fidelity. She rejoiced over
      your blindness, and she will gnash her teeth with rage and grief when she
      hears that it was Tabus who brought light into the darkness that surrounds
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she pushed off the freedman&rsquo;s supporting arms and sank
      back upon the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Hermon tried to thank her; but she would not permit it, and said in
      an almost inaudible tone: &ldquo;I really did not give the salve to do you good&mdash;the
      last act of all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finally she murmured a few words of direction for its use, and added that
      he must keep the sunlight from his blind eyes by bandages and shades, as
      if it were a cruel foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she paused, and Bias asked her another question, she pointed to the
      door, exclaiming as loudly as her weakness permitted, &ldquo;Go, I tell you,
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon obeyed and left her, accompanied by the freedman, who carried the
      box of salve so full of precious promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Bias delivered to the astonished priest of Nemesis the
      large gifts intended for the avenging goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Hermon entered the boat with him and his Egyptian slave, the
      freedman told his master that Gula was again living in perfect harmony
      with the husband who had cast her off, and Taus, Ledscha&rsquo;s younger sister,
      was the wife of the young Biamite who, she had feared, would give up his
      wooing on account of her visit to Hermon&rsquo;s studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long voyage through the canal which had been dug a short time
      before, connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea, the three men
      reached Clysma. Opposite to it, on the eastern shore of the narrow
      northern point of the Erythraean sea&mdash;[Red Sea]&mdash;lay the goal of
      their journey, and thither Bias led his blind master, followed by the
      slave, on shore.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was long since Hermon had felt so free and light-hearted as during this
      voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He firmly believed in his recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days before he had escaped death in the royal palace as if by a
      miracle, and he owed his deliverance to the woman he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Temple of Nemesis at Tennis the conviction that the goddess had
      ceased to persecute him took possession of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, his blind eyes had been unable to see her menacing statue, but not
      even the slightest thrill of horror had seized him in its presence. In
      Alexandria, after his departure from Proclus&rsquo;s banquet, she had desisted
      from pursuing him. Else how would she have permitted him to escape
      uninjured when he was already standing upon the verge of an abyss, and a
      wave of her hand would have sufficed to hurl him into the death-dealing
      gulf?
    </p>
    <p>
      But his swift confession, and the transformation which followed it, had
      reconciled him not only with her, but also with the other gods; for they
      appeared to him in forms as radiant and friendly as in the days of his
      boyhood, when, while Bias took the helm on the long voyage through the
      canal and the Bitter Lakes, he recalled the visible world to his memory
      and, from the rising sun, Phoebus Apollo, the lord of light and purity,
      gazed at him from his golden chariot, drawn by four horses, and Aphrodite,
      the embodiment of all beauty, rose before him from the snowy foam of the
      azure waves. Demeter, in the form of Daphne, appeared, dispensing
      prosperity, above the swaying golden waves of the ripening grain fields
      and bestowing peace beside the domestic hearth. The whole world once more
      seemed peopled with deities, and he felt their rule in his own breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place of which Bias had told him was situated on a lofty portion of
      the shore. Beside the springs which there gushed from the soil of the
      desert grew green palm trees and thorny acacias. Farther on flourished the
      fragrant betharan. About a thousand paces from this spot the faithful
      freedman pitched the little tent obtained in Tennis under the shade of
      several tall palm trees and a sejal acacia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far from the springs lived the same family of Amalekites whom Bias had
      known from boyhood. They raised a few vegetables in little beds, and the
      men acted as guards to the caravans which came from Egypt through the
      peninsula of Sinai to Petrea and Hebron. The daughter of the aged sheik
      whose men accompanied the trains of goods, a pleasant, middle-aged woman,
      recognised the Biamite, who when a boy had recovered under her mother&rsquo;s
      nursing, and promised Bias to honour his blind master as a valued guest of
      the tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until after he had done everything in his power to render life in the
      wilderness endurable, and had placed a fresh bandage over his eyes, would
      Bias leave his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The freedman entered the boat weeping, and Hermon, deeply agitated, turned
      his face toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was left alone with his Egyptian slave, with whom he rarely
      exchanged a word, he fancied that, amid the murmur of the waves washing
      the strand at his feet, blended the sounds of the street which led past
      his house in Alexandria, and with them all sorts of disagreeable memories
      crowded upon him; but soon he no longer heard them, and the next night
      brought refreshing sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even on the second day he felt that the profound silence which surrounded
      him was a benefit. The stillness affected him like something physical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life was certainly monotonous, and at first there were hours when the
      course of the new existence, so devoid of any change, op pressed him, but
      he experienced no tedium. His mental life was too rich, and the
      unburdening of his anxious soul too great a relief for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had shunned serious thought since he left the philosopher&rsquo;s school; but
      here it soon afforded him the highest pleasure, for never had his mind
      moved so freely, so undisturbed by any limit or obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not need to search for what he hoped to find in the wilderness. His
      whole past life passed before him as if by its own volition. All that he
      had ever experienced, learned, thought, felt, rose before his mind with
      wonderful distinctness, and when he overlooked all his mental possessions,
      as if from a high watch-tower in the bright sunshine, he began to consider
      how he had used the details and how he could continue to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever he had seen incorrectly forced itself resistlessly upon him, yet
      here also the Greek nature, deeply implanted in his soul, guarded him, and
      it was easy for him to avoid self-torturing remorse. He only desired to
      utilize for improvement what he recognised as false.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in this delicious silence he listened to the contradictory demands of
      his intellect and his senses, it often seemed as though he was present at
      a discussion between two guests who were exchanging their opinions
      concerning the subject that occupied his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he first learned to deepen sound intellectual power and listen to the
      demands of the heart, or to repulse and condemn them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes, he was still blind; but never had he observed and recognised
      human life and its stage, down to the minutest detail, which his eyes
      refused to show him, so keenly as during these clays. The phenomena which
      had attracted or repelled his vision here appeared nearer and more
      distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he called &ldquo;reality&rdquo; and believed he understood thoroughly and
      estimated correctly, now disclosed many a secret which had previously
      remained concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How defective his visual perception had been! how necessary it now seemed
      to subject his judgment to a new test! Doubtless a wealth of artistic
      subjects had come to him from the world of reality which he had placed far
      above everything else, but a greater and nobler one from the sphere which
      he had shunned as unfruitful and corrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if by magic, the world of ideality opened before him in this exquisite
      silence. He again found in his own soul the joyous creative forces of
      Nature, and the surrounding stillness increased tenfold his capacity of
      perceiving it; nay, he felt as if creative energy dwelt in solitude
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind had always turned toward greatness. The desire to impress his
      works with the stamp of his own overflowing power had carried him far
      beyond moderation in modelling his struggling Maenads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when he sought for subjects, beside the smaller and more simple ones
      appeared mighty and manifold ones, often of superhuman grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if a higher power would at some future day permit him to model with
      his strong hands this battle of the Amazons, this Phoebus Apollo, radiant
      in beauty and the glow of victory, conquering the dragons of darkness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Arachne, too, returned to his mind, and also Demeter. But she did not
      hover before him as the peaceful dispenser of blessings, the preserver of
      peace, but as the maternal earth goddess, robbed of her daughter
      Proserpina. How varied in meaning was this myth!&mdash;and he strove to
      follow it in every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more could come to the blind artist from Nature by the aid of his
      physical vision. The realm of reality was closed to him; but he had found
      the key to that of the ideal, and what he found in it proved to be no less
      true than the objects the other had offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      How rich in forms was the new world which forced itself unbidden on his
      imagination! He who, a short time before, had believed whatever could not
      be touched by the hands was useless for his art, now had the choice among
      a hundred subjects, full of glowing life, which were attainable by no
      organ of the senses. He need fear to undertake none, if only it was worthy
      of representation; for he was sure of his ability, and difficulty did not
      alarm him, but promised to lend creating for the first time its true
      charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, besides, without the interest of animated conversation, without
      festal scenes where, with garlanded head and intoxicating pleasure soaring
      upward from the dust of earth, existence had seemed to him shallow and not
      worth the trouble it imposed upon mortals, solitude now offered him hours
      as happy as he had ever experienced while revelling with gay companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first many things had disturbed them, especially the dissatisfied,
      almost gloomy disposition of his Egyptian slave, who, born in the city and
      accustomed to its life, found it unbearable to stay in the desert with the
      strange blind master, who lived like a porter, and ordered him to prepare
      his wretched fare with the hands skilled in the use of the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this living disturber of the peace was not to annoy the recluse long.
      Scarcely a fortnight after Bias&rsquo;s departure, the slave Patran, who had
      cost so extravagant a sum, vanished one morning with the sculptor&rsquo;s money
      and silver cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rascally trick of a servant whom he had treated with almost brotherly
      kindness wounded Hermon, but he soon regarded the morose fellow&rsquo;s
      disappearance as a benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When for the first time he drank water from an earthen jug, instead of a
      silver goblet, he thought of Diogenes, who cast his cup aside when he saw
      a boy raise water to his lips in his hand, yet with whom the great
      Macedonian conqueror of the world would have changed places &ldquo;if he had not
      been Alexander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The active, merry son of Bias&rsquo;s Amalekite friend gladly rendered him the
      help and guidance for which he had been reluctant to ask his ill-tempered
      slave, and he soon became accustomed to the simple fare of the nomads.
      Bread and milk, fruits and vegetables from his neighbour&rsquo;s little garden,
      satisfied him, and when the wine he had drunk was used, he contented
      himself, obedient to old Tabus&rsquo;s advice, with pure water.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he still had several gold coins on his person, and wore two costly
      rings on his finger, he doubtless thought of sending to Clysma for meat,
      poultry, and wine, but he had refrained from doing so through the advice
      of the Amalekite woman, who anointed his eyes with Tabus&rsquo;s salve and
      protected them by a shade of fresh leaves from the dazzling rays of the
      desert sun. She, like the sorceress on the Owl&rsquo;s Nest, warned him against
      all viands that inflamed the blood, and he willingly allowed her to take
      away what she and her gray-haired father, the experienced head of the
      tribe, pronounced detrimental to his recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the &ldquo;beggar&rsquo;s fare&rdquo; seemed repulsive, but he soon felt that it
      was benefiting him after the riotous life of the last few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when the Amalekite took off his bandage, he thought he saw a
      faint glimmer of light, and how his heart exulted at this faint foretaste
      of the pleasure of sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant hope sprang up with fresh power in his excitable soul, and
      his lost cheerfulness returned to him like a butterfly to the newly opened
      flower. The image of his beloved Daphne rose before him in sunny radiance,
      and he saw himself in his studio in the service of his art.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always been fond of children, and the little ones in the Amalekite
      family quickly discovered this, and crowded around their blind friend, who
      played all sorts of games with them, and in spite of the bandaged eyes,
      over which spread a broad shade of green leaves, could make whistles with
      his skilful artist hands from the reeds and willow branches they brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw before him the object to which his heart still clung as distinctly
      as if he need only stretch out his hand to draw it nearer, and perhaps&mdash;surely
      and certainly, the Amalekite said&mdash;the time would come when he would
      behold it also with his bodily eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the longing should be fulfilled! If his eyes were again permitted to
      convey to him what formerly filled his soul with delight! Yes, beauty&mdash;was
      entitled to a higher place than truth, and if it again unfolded itself to
      his gaze, how gladly and gratefully he would pay homage to it with his
      art!
    </p>
    <p>
      The hope that he might enjoy it once more now grew stronger, for the
      glimmer of light became brighter, and one day, when his skilful nurse
      again took the bandage from his milk-white pupils, he saw something long
      appear, as if through, a mist. It was only the thorny acacia tree at his
      tent; but the sight of the most beautiful of beautiful things never filled
      him with more joyful gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he ordered the less valuable of his two rings to be sold to offer a
      sacrifice to health-bestowing Isis, who had a little temple in Clysma.
    </p>
    <p>
      How fervently he now prayed also to the great Apollo, the foe of darkness
      and the lord of everything light and pure! How yearningly he besought
      Aphrodite to bless him again with the enjoyment of eternal beauty, and
      Eros to heal the wound which his arrow had inflicted upon his heart and
      Daphne&rsquo;s, and bring them together after so much distress and need!
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after the lapse of another week, the bandage was again removed, his
      inmost soul rejoiced, for his eyes showed him the rippling emerald-green
      surface of the Red Sea, and the outlines of the palms, the tents, the
      Amalekite woman, her boy, and her two long-eared goats.
    </p>
    <p>
      How ardently he thanked the gracious deities who, in spite of Straton&rsquo;s
      precepts, were no mere figments of human imagination and, as if he had
      become a child again, poured forth his overflowing heart with mute
      gratitude to his mother&rsquo;s soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist nature, yearning to create, began to stir within more
      ceaselessly than ever before. Already he saw clay and wax assuming forms
      beneath his skilful hands; already he imagined himself, with fresh power
      and delight, cutting majestic figures from blocks of marble, or, by
      hammering, carving, and filing, shaping them from gold and ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he would not take what he intended to create solely from the world of
      reality perceptible to the senses. Oh, no! He desired to show through his
      art the loftiest of ideals. How could he still shrink from using the
      liberty which he had formerly rejected, the liberty of drawing from his
      own inner consciousness what he needed in order to bestow upon the ideal
      images he longed to create the grandeur, strength, and sublimity in which
      he beheld them rise before his purified soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, with all this, he must remain faithful to truth, copy from Nature
      what he desired to represent. Every finger, every lock of hair, must
      correspond with reality to the minutest detail, and yet the whole must be
      pervaded and penetrated, as the blood flows through the body, by the
      thought that filled his mind and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reflected image of the ideal and of his own mood, faithful to truth,
      free, and yet obedient to the demands of moderation&mdash;in this sentence
      Hermon summed up the result of his solitary meditations upon art and works
      of art. Since he had found the gods again, he perceived that the Muse had
      confided to him a sacerdotal office. He intended to perform its duties,
      and not only attract and please the beholder&rsquo;s eyes through his works, but
      elevate his heart and mind, as beauty, truth, grandeur, and eternity
      uplifted his own soul. He recognised in the tireless creative power which
      keeps Nature ever new, fresh, and bewitching, the presence of the same
      deity whose rule manifested itself in the life of his own soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as he denied its existence, he had recognised no being more
      powerful than himself; now that he again felt insignificant beside it, he
      knew himself to be stronger than ever before, that the greatest of all
      powers had become his ally. Now it was difficult for him to understand how
      he could have turned away from the deity. As an artist he, too, was a
      creator, and, while he believed those who considered the universe had come
      into existence of itself, instead of having been created, he had robbed
      himself of the most sublime model. Besides, the greatest charm of his
      noble profession was lost to him. Now he knew it, and was striving toward
      the goal attainable by the artist alone among mortals&mdash;to hold
      intercourse with the deity, and by creations full of its essence elevate
      the world to its grandeur and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, at the end of the second month of his stay in the desert, when
      the Amalekite woman removed the bandage, her boy, whose form he
      distinguished as if through a veil, suddenly exclaimed: &ldquo;The white cover
      on your eyes is melting! They are beginning to sparkle a little, and soon
      they will be perfectly well, and you can carve the lion&rsquo;s head on my
      cane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the artist might really have succeeded in doing so, but he forbade
      himself the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought that the time for departure had now arrived, and an
      irresistible longing urged him back to the world and Daphne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not resist the entreaties of the old sheik and his daughter
      not to risk what he had gained, so he continued to use the shade of
      leaves, and allowed himself to be persuaded to defer his departure until
      the dimness which still prevented his seeing anything distinctly passed
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, the beautiful peace which he had enjoyed of late was over and,
      besides, anxiety for the dear ones in distant lands was constantly
      increasing. He had had no news of them for a long time, and when he
      imagined what fate might have overtaken Archias, and his daughter with
      him, if he had been carried back to the enraged King in Alexandria, a
      terrible dread took possession of him, which scattered even joy in his
      wonderful recovery to the four winds, and finally led him to the
      resolution to return to the world at any risk and devote himself to those
      whose fate was nearer to his heart than his own weal and woe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Hermon, filled with longing, went down toward evening to the shore.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sun was setting, and the riot of colours in the western horizon seemed
      like a mockery of the torturing anxiety which had mastered his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not notice the boat that was approaching the land; many travellers
      who intended to go through Arabia Petrea landed here, and for several days&mdash;he
      knew why&mdash;there had been more stir in these quiet waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he was surprised by the ringing shout with which he had formerly
      announced his approach to Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously agitated by joy, as if the sunset glow before him had
      suddenly been transformed into the dawn of a happy day, he answered by a
      loud cry glad with hope. Although his dim eyes did not yet permit him to
      distinguish who was standing erect in the boat, waving greetings to him,
      he thought he knew whom this exquisite evening was bringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon his own name reached him. It was his &ldquo;wise Bias&rdquo; who shouted, and
      soon, with a throbbing heart, he held out both hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The freedman had performed his commission in the best possible manner, and
      was now no longer bound to silence by oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha had left him and Myrtilus to themselves and, as Bias thought he
      had heard, had sailed with the Gaul Lutarius for Paraetonium, the frontier
      city between the kingdom of Egypt and that of Cyrene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myrtilus felt stronger than he had done for a long time, and had sent him
      back to the blind friend who would need him more than he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      But worthy Bias also brought messages from Archias and Daphne. They were
      well, and his uncle now had scarcely any cause to fear pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the landing of the boat, the shade had covered Hermon&rsquo;s eyes; but
      when, after the freedman&rsquo;s first timid question about his sight, he raised
      it again, at the same time reporting and showing what progress he had
      already made toward recovery, the excess of joy overpowered the freedman,
      and sometimes laughing, sometimes weeping, he kissed the convalescent&rsquo;s
      hands and simple robe. It was some time before he calmed himself again,
      then laying his forefinger on the side of his nose, he said: &ldquo;Therein the
      immortals differ from human beings. We sculptors can only create good work
      with good tools, but the immortals often use the very poorest of all to
      accomplish the best things. You owe your sight to the hate of this old
      witch and mother of pirates, so may she find peace in the grave. She is
      dead. I heard it from a fellow-countryman whom I met in Herocipolis. Her
      end came soon after our visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Bias related what he knew of Hermon&rsquo;s uncle, of Daphne, and Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two letters were to give him further particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came from the woman he loved and from his friend, and as soon as Bias
      had lighted the lamp in the tent, at the same time telling his master in
      advance many items of news they contained, he set about the difficult task
      of reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had certainly scarcely become a master of this art on board the Hydra,
      yet his slow performance did all honour to the patience of his teacher
      Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began with Daphne&rsquo;s letter, but by the desire of prudent Archias it
      communicated few facts. But the protestations of love and expressions of
      longing which filled it pierced the freedman&rsquo;s soul so deeply that his
      voice more than once failed while reading them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myrtilus&rsquo;s letter, on the contrary, gave a minute description of his mode
      of life, and informed his friend what he expected for him and himself in
      the future. The contents of both relieved Hermon&rsquo;s sorely troubled heart,
      made life with those who were dearest to him possible, and explained many
      things which the reports of the slave had not rendered perfectly clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archias had gone with Daphne to the island of Lesbos, his mother&rsquo;s native
      city. The ships which conveyed travellers to Pergamus, where Myrtilus was
      living, touched at this port, and Bias, to whom Hermon had confided the
      refuge of the father and daughter, had sought them there, and found them
      in a beautiful villa.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being released from his oath, Myrtilus had put himself into
      communication with his uncle, and just before Bias&rsquo;s departure the
      merchant had come to Pergamus with his daughter. As he had the most
      cordial reception from the Regent Philetaerus, he seemed inclined to
      settle permanently there.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Myrtilus, he had cast anchor with Ledscha in the little Mysian
      seaport town of Pitane, near the mouth of the Caicus River, on which,
      farther inland, was the rapidly growing city of Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had found a hospitable welcome in the family of a seafarer who were
      relatives, while the Gaul continued his voyage to obtain information about
      his tribe in Syria. But he had already returned when Bias reached Pitane
      with the two talents intended for him. Myrtilus had availed himself of
      Ledscha&rsquo;s permission long before and gone to Pergamus, where he had lived
      and worked in secrecy until, after the freedman&rsquo;s return from Ledscha, who
      at once left Pitane with the Gaul, he was released from his oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the absence of Bias he had modelled a large relief, a triumphal
      procession of Dionysus, and as the renown of his name had previously
      reached Pergamus, the artists and the most distinguished men in the city
      flocked to his studio to admire the work of the famous Alexandrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Philetoerus, who had founded the Pergamenian kingdom seven years
      before, and governed it with great wisdom, came to Myrtilus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like his nephew and heir Eumenes, he was a friend to art, and induced the
      laurel-crowned Alexandrian to execute the relief, modelled in clay, in
      marble for the Temple of Dionysus at Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heir to the throne of Philetaerus, who was now advancing in years, was
      especially friendly to Myrtilus, and did everything in his power to bind
      him to Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He succeeded, for in the beautiful house, located in an extremely
      healthful site, which Eumenes had assigned for a residence and studio to
      the Alexandrian artist, whose work he most ardently admired, and whom he
      regarded as the most welcome of guests, Myrtilus felt better physically
      than he had for years. Besides, he thought that, for many reasons, his
      friend would be less willing to settle in Alexandria, and that the
      presence of his uncle and Daphne would attract him to Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Hermon surely knew that if he came to him as a blind man he
      would find a brother; if he came restored to sight, he would also find a
      brother, and likewise a fellow-artist with whom he could live and work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myrtilus had told the heir to the throne of Pergamus of his richly gifted
      blind relative, and of the peculiarity of his art, and Eumenes eagerly
      endeavoured to induce his beloved guest to persuade his friend to remove
      to his capital, where there was no lack of distinguished leeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Hermon remained blind, he would honour him; if he recovered his sight,
      he would give him large commissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      How deeply these letters moved the heart of the recovering man! What
      prospects they opened for his future life, for love, friendship, and, not
      least, for his art!
    </p>
    <p>
      If he could see&mdash;if he could only see again! This exclamation blended
      with everything he thought, felt, and uttered. Even in sleep it haunted
      him. To regain the clearness of vision he needed for his work, he would
      willingly have submitted to the severest tortures.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Alexandria alone lived the great leeches who could complete the work
      which the salve of an ignorant old woman had begun. Thither he must go,
      though it cost him liberty and life. The most famous surgeon of the Museum
      at the capital had refused his aid under other circumstances. Perhaps he
      would relent if Philippus, a friend of Erasistratus, smoothed the way for
      him, and the old hero was now living very near. The ships, whose number on
      the sea at his feet was constantly increasing, were attracted hither by
      the presence of the Egyptian King and Queen on the isthmus which connects
      Asia and Africa. The priest of Apollo at Clysma, and other distinguished
      Greeks whom he met there, had told him the day before yesterday, and on
      two former visits to the place, what was going on in the world, and
      informed him how great an honour awaited the eastern frontier in these
      days. The appearance of their Majesties in person must not only mean the
      founding of a city, the reception of a victorious naval commander, and the
      consecration of a restored temple, but also have still deeper causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last few years severe physical suffering had brought the
      unfortunate second king of the house of Ptolemy to this place to seek the
      aid of the ancient Egyptian gods, and, besides the philosophy, busy
      himself with the mystic teachings and magic arts of their priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a short period of life seemed allotted to the invalid ruler, and the
      service of the time-honoured god of the dead, to whom he had erected one
      of the most magnificent temples in the world at Alexandria, to which
      Egyptians and Hellenes repaired with equal devotion, opened hopes for the
      life after death which seemed to him worthy of examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason also he desired to secure the favour of the Egyptian
      priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this purpose, for the execution of his wise and beneficent
      arrangements, as well as for the gratification of his expensive tastes,
      large sums of money were required; therefore he devoted himself with
      especial zeal to enlarging the resources of his country, already so rich
      by nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these things he had found an admirable assistant in his sister
      Arsinoe. As the daughter of the father and mother to whom he himself owed
      existence, he could claim for her unassailable legitimacy the same
      recognition from the priesthood, and the same submission from the people
      rendered to his own person, whom the religion of the country commanded
      them to revere as the representative of the sun god.
    </p>
    <p>
      As marriages between brothers and sisters had been customary from ancient
      times, and were sanctioned by religion and myth, he had married the second
      Arsinoe, his sister, immediately after the banishment of the first Queen
      of this name.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the union with her, he called himself Philadelphus&mdash;brotherly
      love&mdash;and honoured his sister and wife with the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, this led the sarcastic Alexandrians to utter many a biting, more or
      less witty jest, but he never had cause to regret his choice; in spite of
      her forty years, and more than one bloody deed which before her marriage
      to him she had committed as Queen of Thrace and as a widow, the second
      Arsinoe was always a pattern of regally aristocratic, dignified bearing
      and haughty womanly beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the first Philadelphus could expect no descendants from her, he had
      provided for securing them through her, for he had induced her to adopt
      the first Arsinoe&rsquo;s three children, who had been taken from their exiled
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arsinoe was now accompanying her royal husband Philadelphus to the eastern
      frontier. There the latter expected to name the city to be newly founded
      &ldquo;Arsinoe&rdquo; for her, and-to show his esteem for the priesthood&mdash;to
      consecrate in person the new Temple of Tum in the city of Pithom, near
      Heroopolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, the monarch had been endeavouring to form new connections with the
      coast countries of eastern Africa, and open them to Egyptian commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admiral Eumedes, the oldest son of Philippus and Thyone, had succeeded in
      doing this most admirably, for the distinguished commander had not only
      founded on the Ethiopian shore of the Red Sea a city which he named for
      the King &ldquo;Ptolemais,&rdquo; but also won over the princes and tribes of that
      region to Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now returning from Ethiopia with a wealth of treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the brilliant festivals the invalid King, with his new wife, was to
      give himself up to complete rest for a month in the healthful air of the
      desert region which surrounded Pithom, far from the tumult of the capital
      and the exhausting duties of government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnificent shows which were to be expected, and the presence of the
      royal pair, had attracted thousands of spectators on foot or horseback,
      and by water, and the morning after Bias&rsquo;s return the sea near Clysma was
      swarming with vessels of all kinds and sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than probable that Philippus, the father, and Thyone, the
      mother of the famous returning Admiral Eumedes, would not fail to be
      present at his reception on his native soil, and therefore Hermon wished
      to seek out his dear old friends in Heroopolis, where the greeting was to
      take place, and obtain their advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat on which the freedman had come was at the disposal of his master
      and himself. Before Hermon entered it, he took leave, with an agitated
      heart and open hand, of his Amalekite friends and, in spite of the mist
      which still obscured everything he beheld, he perceived how reluctantly
      the simple dwellers in the wilderness saw him depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the master and servant entered the boat, in spite of the sturdy
      sailors who manned it, it proved even more difficult than they had feared
      to make any progress; for the whole narrow end of the arm of the sea,
      which here extended between Egypt and Arabia Petrea, was covered with war
      galleys and transports, boats and skiffs. The two most magnificent state
      galleys from Heroopolis were coming here, bearing the ambassadors who, in
      the King&rsquo;s name, were to receive the fleet and its commander. Other large
      and small, richly equipped, or unpretending ships and boats were filled
      with curious spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a gay, animated scene! What brilliant, varied, strange, hitherto
      unseen objects were gathered here: vessels of every form and size, sails
      white, brown, and black, and on the state galleys and boats purple, blue,
      and every colour, adorned with more or less costly embroidery! What rising
      and falling of swiftly or slowly moving oars!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Alexandria!&rdquo; cried Bias, pointing to a state galley which the King
      was sending to the commander of the southern fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there,&rdquo; remarked Hermon, proud of his regained power of
      distinguishing one thing from another, and letting his eyes rest on one of
      the returning transports, on whose deck stood six huge African elephants,
      whose trumpeting mingled with the roaring of the lions and tigers on the
      huge freight vessels, and the exulting shouts of the men and women in the
      ships and boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the King&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo; exclaimed Bias. &ldquo;He probably never received at
      one time before so large an accession to his collection of rare animals.
      What is the transport with the huge lotus flower on the prow probably
      bringing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, and the monkeys and parrots over yonder!&rdquo; joyously exclaimed the
      Amalekite boy who had been Hermon&rsquo;s guide, and had accompanied him into
      the boat. Then he suddenly lowered his voice and, fearing that his delight
      might give pain to the less keen-sighted man whom he loved, he asked, &ldquo;You
      can see them, my lord, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my boy, though less plainly than you do,&rdquo; replied Hermon,
      stroking the lad&rsquo;s dark hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the admiral&rsquo;s ship had approached the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bias pointed to the poop, where the commander Eumedes was standing
      directing the course of the fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if moulded in bronze, a man thoroughly equal to his office, he seemed,
      in spite of the shouts, greetings, and acclamations thundering around him,
      to close his eyes and ears to the vessels thronging about his ship and
      devote himself body and soul to the fulfilment of his duty. He had just
      embraced his father and mother, who had come here to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The King undoubtedly sent by his father the laurel wreath on his helmet,&rdquo;
       observed Bias, pointing to the admiral. &ldquo;So many honours while he is still
      so young! When you went to the wrestling school in Alexandria, Eumedes was
      scarcely eight years older than you, and I remember how he preferred you
      to the others. A sign, and he will notice us and allow you to go on his
      ship, or, at any rate, send us a boat in which we can enter the canal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Hermon. &ldquo;My call would disturb him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us make ourselves known to the Lady Thyone or her husband,&rdquo; the
      freedman continued. &ldquo;They will certainly take us on their large state
      galley, from which, though your eyes do not yet see as far as a falcon&rsquo;s,
      not a ship, not a man, not a movement will escape them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Hermon added one more surprise to the many which he had already given,
      for he kindly declined Bias&rsquo;s well-meant counsel, and, resting his hand on
      the Amalekite boy&rsquo;s shoulder, said modestly: &ldquo;I am no longer the Hermon
      whom Eumedes preferred to the others. And the Lady Thyone must not be
      reminded of anything sad in this festal hour for the mother&rsquo;s heart. I
      shall meet her to-morrow, or the day after, and yet I had intended to let
      no one who is loyal to me look into my healing eyes before Daphne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he felt the freedman&rsquo;s hand secretly press his, and it comforted him,
      after the sorrowful thoughts to which he had yielded, amid the shouts of
      joy ringing around him. How quietly, with what calm dignity, Eumedes
      received the well-merited homage, and how disgracefully the false fame had
      bewildered his own senses!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he had not passed through the purifying fire of misfortune in vain!
      The past should not cloud the glad anticipation of brighter days!
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing a long breath, he straightened himself into a more erect posture,
      and ordered the men to push the boat from the shore. Then he pressed a
      farewell kiss on the Amalekite boy&rsquo;s forehead, the lad sprang ashore, and
      the journey northward began.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the sailors feared that the crowd would be too great, and the
      boat would be refused admission to the canal; but the helmsman succeeded
      in keeping close behind a vessel of medium size, and the Macedonian guards
      of the channel put no obstacle in their countryman&rsquo;s way, while boats
      occupied by Egyptians and other barbarians were kept back.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Bitter Lakes, whose entire length was to be traversed, the ships
      had more room, and after a long voyage through dazzling sunlight, and
      along desolate shores, the boat anchored at nightfall at Heroopolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon and Bias obtained shelter on one of the ships which the sovereign
      had placed at the disposal of the Greeks who came to participate in the
      festivals to be celebrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his master went to rest, the freedman&mdash;whom he had sent out to
      look for a vessel bound to Pelusium and Alexandria the next day or the
      following one&mdash;returned to the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had talked with the Lady Thyone, and told Hermon from her that she
      would visit or send for him the next day, after the festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own mother, the freedman protested, could not have rejoiced more
      warmly over the commencement of his recovery, and she would have come with
      him at once had not Philippus prevented his aged wife, who was exhausted
      by the long journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the sun poured a wealth of radiant light upon the desert,
      the green water of the harbour, and the gray and yellow walls of the
      border fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three worlds held out their hands to one another on this water way
      surrounded by the barren wilderness&mdash;Egypt, Hellas, and Semitic Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the first belonged the processions of priests, who, with images of the
      gods, consecrated vessels, and caskets of relics, took their places at the
      edge of the harbour. The tawny and black, half-naked soldiers who, with
      high shields, lances, battle-axes and bows, gathered around strangely
      shaped standards, joined them, amid the beating of drums and blare of
      trumpets, as if for their protection. Behind them surged a vast multitude
      of Egyptians and dark-skinned Africans.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the canal the Asiatics were moving to and fro. The
      best places for spectators had been assigned to the petty kings and
      princes of tribes, Phoenician and Syrian merchants, and well-equipped,
      richly armed warriors. Among them thronged owners of herds and seafarers
      from the coast. Until the reception began, fresh parties of bearded sons
      of the desert, in floating white bernouse, mounted on noble steeds, were
      constantly joining the other Asiatics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The centre was occupied by the Greeks. The appearance of every individual
      showed that they were rulers of the land, and that they deserved to be.
      How free and bold was their bearing! how brightly and joyously sparkled
      the eyes of these men, whose wreaths of green leaves and bright-hued
      flowers adorned locks anointed for the festivals! Strong and slender, they
      were conspicuous in their stately grace among the lean Egyptians,
      unbridled in their jests and jeers, and the excitable Asiatics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the blare of trumpets and the roll of drums shook the air like echoing
      lightning and heavy peals of thunder; the Egyptian priests sang a hymn of
      praise to the God King and Goddess Queen, and the aristocratic priestesses
      of the deity tinkled the brass rings on the sistrum. Then a chorus of
      Hellenic singers began a polyphonous hymn, and amid its full, melodious
      notes, which rose above the enthusiastic shouts of &ldquo;Hail!&rdquo; from the
      multitude, King Ptolemy and his sister-wife showed themselves to the
      waiting throng. Seated on golden thrones borne on the broad shoulders of
      gigantic black Ethiopians, and shaded by lofty canopies, both were raised
      above the crowd, whom they saluted by gracious gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The athletic young bearers of the large round ostrich-feather fans which
      protected them from the sunbeams were followed in ranks by the monarch&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;relatives&rdquo; and &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; the dignitaries, the dark and fair-haired bands
      of the guards of Grecian youths and boys, as well as divisions of the
      picked corps of the Hetairoi, Diadochi, and Epigoni, in beautiful plain
      Macedonian armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were followed in the most informal manner by scholars from the
      Museum, many Hellenic artists, and wealthy gentlemen of Alexandria of
      Greek and Jewish origin, whom the King had invited to the festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his train they went on board the huge galley on which the reception was
      to take place. Scarcely had the last one stepped on the deck when it
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eumedes came from the admiral&rsquo;s galley to the King&rsquo;s. Ptolemy embraced him
      like a friend, and Arsinoe added a wreath of fresh roses to the laurel
      crown which the sovereign had sent the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time thundering plaudits echoed from the walls of the
      fortifications and broke, sometimes rising, sometimes falling, against the
      ships and masts in the calm water of the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King had little time to lose. Even festal joy must move swiftly. There
      were many and varied things to be seen and done; but in the course of an
      hour&mdash;so ran the order&mdash;this portion of the festivities must be
      over, and it was fully obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands and feet of the woolly-headed blacks who, amid loud
      acclamations, carried on shore the cages in which lions, panthers, and
      leopards shook the bars with savage fury, moved as if they were winged.
      The slender, dark-brown Ethiopians who led giraffes, apes, gazelles, and
      greyhounds past the royal pair rushed along as if they were under the
      lash; and the sixty elephants which Eumedes and his men had caught in the
      land of Chatyth moved at a rapid pace past the royal state galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of them the King joined in the cheers of thousands of voices
      on the shore; these giant animals were to him auxiliaries who could put to
      flight a whole corps of hostile cavalry, and Arsinoe-Philadelphus, the
      Queen, sympathized with his pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her voice with her royal husband, and it seemed to the
      spectators on the shore as if they had a share in the narrative when she
      listened to Eumedes&rsquo;s first brief report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only specimens of the gold and ivory, spices and rare woods, juniper trees
      and skins of animals which the ships brought home could be borne past
      their Majesties, and the black and brown men who carried them moved at a
      breathless rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was still far from the meridian when the royal couple and their
      train withdrew from the scene of the reception ceremonial, and drove, in a
      magnificent chariot drawn by four horses, to the neighbouring city of
      Pithoin, where new entertainments and a long period of rest awaited them.
      Hermon had seen, as if through a veil of white mists, the objects that
      aroused the enthusiasm of the throng, and so, he said to himself, it had
      been during the whole course of his life. Only the surface of the
      phenomena on which he fixed his eyes had been visible to him; he had not
      learned to penetrate further into their nature, fathom them to their
      depths, until he became blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the gods fulfilled his hope, if he regained his vision entirely, and
      even the last mists had vanished, he would hold firmly to the capacity he
      had gained, and use it in life as well as in art.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The messenger from Philippus appeared in the afternoon. It was the young
      hipparch who had studied in Athens and accompanied the commandant of
      Pelusium to Tennis the year before. He came charged with the commission to
      convey the artist, in the carriage of the gray-haired comrade of
      Alexander, to the neighbouring city of Pithom, where Philippus, by the
      King&rsquo;s command, was now residing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way the hipparch told the sculptor that the Lady Thyone had
      recently done things unprecedented for a woman of her age.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been present at the founding of the city of Arsinoe, as well as at
      the laying of the corner stone of the temple which was to be consecrated
      to the new god Serapis in the neighbourhood. The day before she had
      welcomed her returning son before the entry of the fleet into the canal,
      and to-day had remained from the beginning to the end of his reception by
      the King, without being unduly wearied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first thought, after the close of the ceremony, had concerned her
      convalescing young friend. New entertainments, in which the Queen
      commanded her to participate, awaited her in Pithom, but pleasure at the
      return of her famous son appeared to double her power of endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pithom was the sacred name of the temple precincts of the desert city of
      Thekut&mdash;[The biblical Suchot]&mdash;near Heroopolis, where the
      citizens lived and pursued their business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travellers reached the place very speedily. Garlands of flowers and
      hangings adorned the houses. The sacred precinct Pithom, above which
      towered the magnificently restored temple of the god Turn, was also still
      adorned with many superb ones, as well as lofty masts, banners, and
      triumphal arches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they reached it the equipage passed the sumptuous tents which had
      been erected for the royal pair and their attendants. If Hermon had not
      known how long the monarch intended to remain here, their size and number
      would have surprised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A regular messenger and carrier-dove service had been established between
      Alexandria and Pithom for the period of Ptolemy&rsquo;s relaxation; and the
      sovereign was accompanied not only by several of the chief councillors and
      secretaries, but artists and some of the Museum scientists with whom he
      was on specially intimate terms, who were to adorn the festival on the
      frontier with their presence, and cheer the invalid King, who needed
      entertainment. Singers and actors also belonged to the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed the encampment of the troops who accompanied the sovereign,
      the hipparch could show Hermon a magnificent military spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heroopolis was fortified, and belonged to the military colonies which
      Alexander the Great had established throughout all Egypt in order to win
      it over more quickly to Grecian customs. A Hellenic phalanx and Libyan
      mercenaries formed the garrison there, but at Pithom the King had gathered
      the flower of his troops around him, and this circumstance showed how
      little serious consideration the cautious ruler, who usually carefully
      regarded every detail, gave to the war with Cyrene, in which he took no
      personal part. The four thousand Gauls whom he had sent across the
      frontier as auxiliary troops promised to become perilous to the foe, who
      was also threatened in the rear by one of the most powerful Libyan tribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the artist was assured by his military companion, Philadelphus
      could let the campaign take its course, and permit himself the brief
      period of rest in this strangely chosen place, which the leeches had
      advised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house where the aged couple lived with their son, Admiral Eumedes, was
      on the edge of the precincts of the temple. It belonged to the most
      distinguished merchant in the place, and consisted of a large open
      courtyard in the form of a square, surrounded by the building and its
      communicating wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hipparch led Hermon into this place a number of people had
      already assembled there. Soldiers and sailors stood in groups in the
      centre, awaiting the orders of the old general and his subordinate
      officers. Messengers and slaves, coming and going on various errands, were
      crossing it, and on the shady side benches and chairs stood under a light
      awning. Most of these were occupied by visitors who came to congratulate
      the mother of the fame-crowned admiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone was reclining on a divan in their midst, submitting with a sigh to
      the social duties which her high position imposed upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was turned toward the large doorway of the main entrance, while
      she sometimes greeted newly introduced guests, sometimes bade farewell to
      departing ones, and meanwhile answered and asked questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been more wearied by the exertions of the last few days than her
      animated manner revealed. Yet as soon as Hermon, leaning on the young
      hipparch&rsquo;s arm, approached her, she rose and cordially extended both hands
      to him. True, the recovering man was still unable to see her features
      distinctly, but he felt the maternal kindness with which she received him,
      and what his eyes could not distinguish his ears taught him in her warm
      greetings. His heart dilated and, after he had kissed her dear old hand
      more than once with affectionate devotion, she led him among her guests
      and presented him to them as the son of her dearest friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange stir ran through the assembled group, nearly all whose members
      belonged to the King&rsquo;s train, and the low whispers and murmurs around him
      revealed to Hermon that the false wreaths he wore had by no means been
      forgotten in this circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A painful feeling of discomfort overwhelmed the man accustomed to the
      silence of the desert, and a voice within cried with earnest insistence,
      &ldquo;Away from here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had no time to obey it; an unusually tall, broad-shouldered man,
      with a thick gray beard and grave, well-formed features, in whom he
      thought he recognised the great physician Erasistratus, approached Thyone,
      and asked, &ldquo;The recluse from the desert with restored sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; replied the matron, and whispered to the other, who was really
      the famous scientist and leech whom Hermon had desired to seek in
      Alexandria. &ldquo;Exhaustion will soon overcome me, and how many important
      matters I had to discuss with you and the poor fellow yonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician laid his hand on the matron&rsquo;s temples, and, raising his
      voice, said in a tone of grave anxiety: &ldquo;Exhaustion! It would be better
      for you, honoured lady, to keep your bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely and certainly!&rdquo; the wife of the chief huntsman instantly assented.
      &ldquo;We have already taxed your strength far too long, my noble friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This welcome confession produced a wonderful effect upon the other
      visitors, and very soon the last one had vanished from the space under the
      awning and the courtyard. Not a single person had vouchsafed Hermon a
      greeting; for the artist, divested of the highest esteem, had been
      involved in the ugly suspicion of having driven his uncle from Alexandria,
      and the monarch was said to have spoken unfavourably of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last one had left the courtyard, the leech exchanged a quick
      glance of understanding, which also included Hermon, with Thyone, and the
      majordomo received orders to admit no more visitors, while Erasistratus
      exclaimed gaily, &ldquo;It is one of the physician&rsquo;s principal duties to keep
      all harmful things&mdash;including living ones&mdash;from his patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to Hermon and had already begun to question him about his
      health, when the majordomo announced another visitor. &ldquo;A very
      distinguished gentleman, apparently,&rdquo; he said hastily; &ldquo;Herophilus of
      Chalcedon, who would not be denied admittance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the eyes of Erasistratus and the matron met, and the former hastened
      toward his professional colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two physicians stopped in the middle of the courtyard and talked
      eagerly together, while Thyone, with cordial interest, asked Hermon to
      tell her what she had already partially learned through the freedman Bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Erasistratus persuaded the matron, who seemed to have forgotten
      her previous exhaustion, to share the consultation, but the convalescent&rsquo;s
      heart throbbed faster as he watched the famous leeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these two men took charge of his case, the most ardent desire of his
      soul might be fulfilled, and Thyone was certainly trying to induce them to
      undertake his treatment; what else would have drawn her away from him
      before she had said even one word about Daphne?
    </p>
    <p>
      The sculptor saw, as if through a cloud of dust, the three consulting
      together in the centre of the courtyard, away from the soldiers and
      messengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon had only seen Erasistratus indistinctly, but before his eyes were
      blinded he had met him beside the sick-bed of Myrtilus, and no one who had
      once beheld it could forget the manly bearded face, with the grave,
      thoughtful eyes, whose gaze deliberately sought their goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other also belonged to the great men in the realm of intellect. Hermon
      knew him well, for he had listened eagerly in the Museum to the lectures
      of the famous Herophilus, and his image also had stamped itself upon his
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at that time the long, smooth hair of the famous investigator had
      turned gray. From the oval of his closely shaven, well-formed face, with
      the long, thin, slightly hooked nose, a pair of sparkling eyes had gazed
      with penetrating keenness at the listeners. Hermon had imagined Aristotle
      like him, while the bust of Pythagoras, with which he was familiar,
      resembled Erasistratus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convalescent could scarcely expect anything more than beneficial
      advice from Herophilus; for this tireless investigator rarely rendered
      assistance to the sick in the city, because the lion&rsquo;s share of his time
      and strength were devoted to difficult researches. The King favoured these
      by placing at his disposal the criminals sentenced to death. In his work
      of dissection he had found that the human brain was the seat of the soul,
      and the nerves originated in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasistratus, on the contrary, devoted himself to a large medical
      practice, though science owed him no less important discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle of artists had heard what he taught concerning the blood in the
      veins and the air bubbles in the arteries, how he explained the process of
      breathing, and what he had found in the investigation of the beating of
      the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he performed his most wonderful work with the knife in his hand as a
      surgeon. He had opened the body of one of Archias&rsquo;s slaves, who had been
      nursed by Daphne, and cured him after all other physicians had given him
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this man&rsquo;s voice reached Hermon, he repeated to himself the words of
      refusal with which the great physician had formerly declined to devote his
      time and skill to him. Perhaps he was right then&mdash;and how differently
      he treated him to-day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone had informed the famous scientist of everything which she knew from
      Hermon, and had learned of the last period of his life through Bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now listened with eager interest, sometimes completing Hermon&rsquo;s
      acknowledgments by an explanatory or propitiating word, as the leeches
      subjected him to a rigid examination, but the latter felt that his
      statements were not to serve curiosity, but an honest desire to aid him.
      So he spoke to them with absolute frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the examination was over, Erasistratus exclaimed to his professional
      colleague: &ldquo;This old woman! Precisely as I would have prescribed. She
      ordered the strictest diet with the treatment. She rejected every strong
      internal remedy, and forbade him wine, much meat, and all kinds of
      seasoning. Our patient was directed to live on milk and the same simple
      gifts of Nature which I would have ordered for him. The herb juice in the
      clever sorceress&rsquo;s salve proved the best remedy. The incantations could do
      no harm. On the contrary, they often produce a wonderful effect on the
      mind, and from it proceed further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Erasistratus asked to have a description of the troubles which still
      affected Hermon&rsquo;s vision, and the passionate eagerness with which the
      leeches gazed into his eyes strengthened the artist&rsquo;s budding hope. Never
      had he wished more ardently that Daphne was back at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also listened with keen attention when the scientists finally discussed
      in low tones what they had perceived, and caught the words, &ldquo;White scar on
      the cornea,&rdquo; &ldquo;leucoma,&rdquo; and &ldquo;operation.&rdquo; He also heard Herophilus declare
      that an injury of the cornea by the flame of the torch was the cause of
      the blindness. In the work which led him to the discovery of the retina in
      the eye he had devoted himself sedulously to the organs of sight. This
      case seemed as if it had been created for his friend&rsquo;s keen knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      What expectations this assurance aroused in the half-cured man, who felt
      as if the goal was already gained, when, shortly after, Erasistratus, the
      greatest physician of his time, offered to make the attempt in Alexandria
      to remove, by a few little incisions, what still dimmed his impaired
      vision!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon, deeply agitated, thanked the leech, and when Thyone perceived what
      was passing in his mind she ventured to ask the question whether it would
      not be feasible to perform the beneficent work here, and, if possible, the
      next day, and the surgeon was ready to fulfil the wish of the matron and
      the sufferer speedily. He would bring the necessary instruments with him.
      It only depended upon whether a suitable room could be found in the
      crowded city, and Thyone believed that such a one could not be lacking in
      the great building at her disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short conversation with the steward confirmed this opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Erasistratus appointed the next morning for the operation. During the
      ceremony of consecrating the temple it would be quiet in the house and its
      vicinity. The preliminary fasting which he imposed upon his patients
      Hermon had already undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pure desert air here,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;will be of the utmost assistance in
      recovery. The operation is slight, and free from danger. A few days will
      determine its success. I shall remain here with their Majesties, only&rdquo;&mdash;and
      here he hesitated doubtfully&mdash;&ldquo;where shall I find a competent
      assistant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herophilus looked his colleague in the face with a sly smile, saying, &ldquo;If
      you credit the old man of Chalcedon with the needful skill, he is at your
      disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herophilus!&rdquo; cried Thyone, and tears of emotion wet her aged eyes, which
      easily overflowed; but when Hermon tried to give expression to his fervent
      gratitude in words, Erasistratus interrupted him, exclaiming, as he
      grasped his comrade&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;It honours the general in his purple robe,
      when he uses the spade in the work of intrenchment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many other matters were discussed before the professional friends
      withdrew, promising to go to work early the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept their word, and while the temple of the god Turn resounded with
      music and the chanting of hymns by the priests, whose dying notes entered
      the windows of the sick-room, while Queen Arsinoe-Philadelphus led the
      procession, and the King, who was prevented by the gout from entering and
      passing around the sanctuary at her side, ordered a monument to be erected
      in commemoration of this festival, the famous leeches toiled busily.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the music and the acclamations of the crowd died away, their task was
      accomplished. The great Herophilus had rendered his equally distinguished
      colleague the aid of an apprentice. When Hermon&rsquo;s lips again tried to pour
      forth his gratitude, Herophilus interrupted him with the exclamation: &ldquo;Use
      the sight you have regained, young master, in creating superb works of
      art, and I shall be in your debt, since, with little trouble, I was
      permitted to render a service to the whole Grecian world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon spent seven long days and nights full of anxious expectation in a
      darkened room. Bias and a careful old female slave of the Lady Thyone
      watched him faithfully. Philippus, his wife, and his famous son Eumedes
      were allowed to pay him only brief visits; but Erasistratus watched the
      success of the operation every morning. True, it had been by no means
      dangerous, and certainly would not have required his frequent visits, but
      it pleased the investigator, reared in the school of Stoics, to watch how
      this warm-blooded young artist voluntarily submitted to live in accord
      with reason and Nature&mdash;the guiding stars of his own existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hermon opened his soul to his learned friend, and what Erasistratus
      thus learned strengthened the conviction of this great alleviator of
      physical pain that suffering and knowledge of self were the best
      physicians for the human soul. The scientist, who saw in the arts the
      noblest ornament of mortal life, anticipated with eager interest Hermon&rsquo;s
      future creative work.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the seventh day the leech removed the bandage from his patient&rsquo;s eyes,
      and the cry of rapture with which Hermon clasped him in his arms richly
      rewarded him for his trouble and solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The restored man beheld in sharp, clear, undimmed outlines everything at
      which the physician desired him to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Erasistratus could write to his friend Herophilus in Alexandria that
      the operation was successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sculptor was ordered to avoid the dazzling sunlight a fortnight
      longer, then he might once more use his eyes without restriction, and
      appeal to the Muse to help in creating works of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thyone was present at this explanation. After she had conquered the great
      emotion which for a time sealed her lips, her first question, after the
      physician&rsquo;s departure, was: &ldquo;And Nemesis? She too, I think, has fled
      before the new light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon pressed her hand still more warmly, exclaiming with joyous
      confidence: &ldquo;No, Thyone! True, I now have little reason to fear the
      avenging goddess who pursues the criminal, but all the more the other
      Nemesis, who limits the excess of happiness. Will she not turn her swift
      wheel, when I again, with clear eyes, see Daphne, and am permitted to work
      in my studio once more with keen eyes and steady hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the barriers which had hitherto restricted Hermon&rsquo;s social intercourse
      also fell. Eumedes, the commander of the fleet, often visited him, and
      while exchanging tales of their experiences they became friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hermon was alone with Thyone and her gray-haired husband, the
      conversation frequently turned upon Daphne and her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the recovered artist learned to whom Archias owed his escape from
      being sentenced to death and having his property confiscated. Papers,
      undeniably genuine, had proved what large sums had been advanced by the
      merchant during the period of the first Queen Arsinoe&rsquo;s conspiracy, and
      envious foes had done their best to prejudice the King and his sister-wife
      against Archias. Then the gray-haired hero fearlessly interceded for his
      friend, and the monarch did not remain deaf to his representations. King
      Ptolemy was writing the history of the conqueror of the world, and needed
      the aged comrade of Alexander, the sole survivor who had held a prominent
      position in the great Macedonian&rsquo;s campaigns. It might be detrimental to
      his work, on which he set great value, if he angered the old warrior, who
      was a living source of history. Yet the King was still ill-disposed to the
      merchant, for while he destroyed Archias&rsquo;s death sentence which had been
      laid before him for his signature, he said to Philippus: &ldquo;The money-bag
      whose life I give you was the friend of my foe. Let him beware that my arm
      does not yet reach him from afar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nay, his resentment went so far that he refused to receive Hermon, when
      Eumedes begged permission to present the artist whose sight had been so
      wonderfully restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me he is still the unjustly crowned conspirator,&rdquo; Philadelphus
      replied. &ldquo;Let him create the remarkable work which I formerly expected
      from him, and perhaps I shall have a somewhat better opinion of him, deem
      him more worthy of our favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances it was advisable for Archias and Daphne to
      remain absent from Alexandria, and the experienced couple could only
      approve Hermon&rsquo;s decision to go to Pergamus as soon as Erasistratus
      dismissed him. A letter from Daphne, which reached Thyone&rsquo;s hands at this
      time, increased the convalescent&rsquo;s already ardent yearning to the highest
      pitch. The girl entreated her maternal friend to tell her frankly the
      condition of her lover&rsquo;s health. If he had recovered, he would know how to
      find her speedily; if the blindness was incurable, she would come herself
      to help him bear the burden of his darkened existence. Chrysilla would
      accompany her, but she could leave her father alone in Pergamus a few
      months without anxiety, for he had a second son there in his nephew
      Myrtilus, and had found a kind friend in Philetaerus, the ruler of the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time Hermon daily urged Erasistratus to grant him entire
      liberty, but the leech steadfastly refused, though he knew whither his
      young friend longed to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until the beginning of the fourth week after the operation did he
      himself lead Hermon into the full sunlight, and when the recovered artist
      came out of the house he raised his hands in mute prayer, gushing from the
      inmost depths of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was to return to Alexandria in a few days, and at the same time
      Philippus and Thyone were going back to Pelusium. Hermon wished to
      accompany them there and sail thence on a ship bound for Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Eumedes he visited the unfamiliar scenes around him, and his newly
      restored gift of sight presented to him here many things that formerly he
      would scarcely have noticed, but which now filled him with grateful joy.
      Gratitude, intense gratitude, had taken possession of his whole being.
      This feeling mastered him completely and seemed to be fostered and
      strengthened by every breath, every heart throb, every glance into his own
      soul and the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, many beauties, nay, even many marvels, presented themselves to
      his restored eyes. The whole wealth of the magic of beauty, intellect, and
      pleasure in life, characteristic of the Greek nature, appeared to have
      followed King Ptolemy and Queen Arsinoe-Philadelphus hither. Gardens had
      been created on the arid, sandy soil, whose gray and yellow surface
      extended in every direction, the water on the shore of the canal which
      united Pithom with the Nile not sufficing to render it possible to make
      even a narrow strip of arable land. Fresh water flowed from beautiful
      fountains adorned with rich carvings, and the pure fluid filled large
      porphyry and marble basins. Statues, single and in groups, stood forth in
      harmonious arrangement against green masses of leafage, and Grecian
      temples, halls, and even a theatre, rapidly constructed in the noblest
      forms from light material, invited the people to devotion, to the
      enjoyment of the most exquisite music, and to witness the perfect
      performance of many a tragedy and comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statues surrounded the hurriedly erected palaestra where the Ephebi every
      morning practised their nude, anointed bodies in racing, wrestling, and
      throwing the discus. What a delight it was to Hermon to feast his eyes
      upon these spectacles! What a stimulus to the artist, so long absorbed in
      his own thoughts, who had so recently returned from the wilderness to the
      world of active life, when he was permitted, in Erasistratus&rsquo;s tent, to
      listen to the great scholars who had accompanied the King to the desert!
      Only the regret that Daphne was not present to share his pleasure clouded
      Hermon&rsquo;s enjoyment, when Eumedes related to his parents, himself, and a
      few chosen friends the adventures encountered, and the experiences
      gathered in distant Ethiopia, on land and water, in battle and the chase,
      as investigator and commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      The utmost degree of variety had entered into the simplicity of the
      monotonous desert, the most refined abundance for the intellect and the
      need of beauty appeared amid its barrenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet Callimachus had just arrived with a new chorus of singers,
      tablets by Antiphilus and Nicias had come to beautify the last days of the
      residence in the desert&mdash;when doves, the birds of Aphrodite, flew
      with the speed of lightning into Pithom, but instead of bringing a new
      message of love and announcing the approach of fresh pleasure, they bore
      terrible tidings which put joy to flight and stifled mirthfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unbridled greed of rude barbarians had chosen Alexandria for its goal,
      and startled the royal pair and their chosen companions from the sea of
      pleasure where they would probably have remained for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four thousand Gauls who had been obtained to fight against Cyrene were
      in the act of rushing rapaciously upon the richest city in the world. The
      most terrible danger hung like a black cloud over the capital founded by
      Alexander, whose growth had been so rapid. True, General Satvrus asserted
      that he was strong enough, with the troops at his disposal, to defeat the
      formidable hordes; but a second dove, sent by the epitropus who had
      remained in Alexandria, alluded to serious disaster which it would
      scarcely be possible to avert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doves now flew swiftly to and fro; but before the third arrived,
      Eumedes, the commander of the fleet just from Ethiopia, was already on the
      way to Alexandria with all the troops assembled on the frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King and Queen, with the corps of pages and the corps of youths,
      entered the boats waiting for them to return, drawn by teams of four swift
      horses, to Memphis, to await within the impregnable fortress of the White
      Castle the restoration of security in the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greeks prized the most valiant fearlessness so highly that no shadow
      could be suffered to rest upon the King&rsquo;s, and therefore the monarch&rsquo;s
      hurried departure was made in a way which permitted no thought of flight,
      and merely resembled impatient yearning for new festivals and the earnest
      desire to fulfil grave duties in another portion of the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the companions of the royal pair, among them Erasistratus,
      accompanied them. Hermon bade him farewell with a troubled heart, and the
      leech, too, parted with regret from the artist to whom, a year before, he
      had refused his aid.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hermon went, with Philippus and Thyone, on board the ship which was to
      convey them through the new canal to Pelusium, where the old commandant
      had to plan all sorts of measures. In the border fortress the artist was
      again obliged to exercise patience, for no ship bound to Pergamus or
      Lesbos could be found in the harbour. Philippus had as much work as he
      could do, but all his arrangements were made when carrier doves announced
      that the surprise intended by the Gauls had been completely thwarted, and
      his son Eumedes was empowered to punish them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admiral would take his fleet to the Sebennytic mouth of the Nile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another dove came from King Ptolemy, and summoned the old general at once
      to the capital. Philippus resolved to set off without delay and, as the
      way led past that mouth of the Nile, met his son on the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon must accompany him and his wife to Alexandria, whence, without
      entering the city, he could sail for Pergamus; ships bound to all the
      ports in the Mediterranean were always in one of the harbours of the
      capital. A galley ready to weigh anchor was constantly at the disposal of
      the commandant of the fortress, and the next noon the noble pair, with
      Hermon and his faithful Bias, went on board the Galatea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was dull, and gray clouds were sweeping across the sky over
      the swift vessel, which hugged the coast, and, unless the wind shifted,
      would reach the narrow tongue of land pierced by the Sebennytic mouth of
      the Nile before sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the general and his wife went to rest early, Hermon could not
      endure the close air of the cabin. Wrapped in his cloak he went on deck.
      The moon, almost full, was sailing in the sky, sometimes covered by dark
      clouds, sometimes leaving them behind. Like a swan emerging from the
      shadow of the thickets along the shore upon the pure bosom of the lake, it
      finally floated into the deep azure of the radiant firmament. Hermon&rsquo;s
      heart swelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he rejoiced that he was again permitted to behold the starry sky, and
      satiate his soul with the beauty of creation! What delight it gave him
      that the eternal wanderers above were no longer soulless forms, that he
      again saw in the pure silver disk above friendly Selene, in the rolling
      salt waves the kingdom of Poseidon! To-morrow, when the deep blue water
      was calm, he would greet the sea-god Glaucus, and when snowy foam crowned
      the crests of the waves, white-armed Thetis. The wind was no longer an
      empty sound to him; no, it, too, came from a deity. All Nature had
      regained a new, divine life. Doubtless he felt much nearer to his
      childhood than before, but he was infinitely less distant from the eternal
      divinity. And all the forms, so full of meaning, which appeared to him
      from Nature, and from every powerful emotion of his own soul, were waiting
      to be represented by his art in the noblest of forms, those of human
      beings. There were few with whose nature he had not become familiar in the
      darkness and solitude that once surrounded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he began to create again, he had only to summon them, and he awaited,
      with the suspense of the general who is in command of new troops on the
      eve of battle, the success of his own work after the great transformation
      which had taken place in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a stress and tumult!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had controlled it since the first hour when he regained his full
      vision. He would fain have transformed the moon into the sun, the ship
      into the studio, and begun to model.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, too, what he desired to create.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would model an Apollo trampling under foot the slain dragon of
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would succeed in this work now. And as he looked up and saw Selene just
      emerging again from the black cloud island, the thought entered his mind
      that it was a moonlight night like this when all the unspeakably terrible
      misfortune occurred&mdash;which was now past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet neither the calm wanderer above nor a resentful woman had exposed him
      to the persecution of Nemesis. In the stillness of the desert he had
      perceived what had brought all this terrible suffering upon him; but he
      would not repeat it to himself now, for he felt within his soul the power
      to remain faithful to his best self in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      With clear eyes he gazed keenly and blithely at the new life. Nothing,
      least of all, futile self-torturing regret for faults committed, should
      cloud the fair morning dawning anew for him, which summoned him to active
      work, to gratitude and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uttering a sigh of relief, he paced the deck&mdash;now brilliantly
      illuminated by silvery light&mdash;with long strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon above his head reminded him of Ledscha. He was no longer angry
      with her. The means by which she had intended to destroy him had been
      transformed into a benefit, and while in the desert he had perceived how
      often man finally blesses, as the highest gain, what he at first regarded
      as the most cruel affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      How distinctly the image of the Biamite again stood before his agitated
      soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he not loved her once?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or how had it happened that, though his heart was Daphne&rsquo;s, and hers
      alone, he had felt wounded and insulted when his Bias, who was leaning
      over the railing of the deck yonder, gazing at the glittering waves, had
      informed him that Ledscha had been accompanied in her flight from her
      unloved husband by the Gaul whose life he, Hermon, had saved? Was this due
      to jealousy or merely wounded vanity at being supplanted in a heart which
      he firmly believed belonged, though only in bitter hate, solely to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      She certainly had not forgotten him, and while the remembrance of her
      blended with the yearning for Daphne which never left him, he sat down and
      gazed out into the darkness till his head drooped on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a dream showed the Biamite to the slumbering man, yet no longer in
      the guise of a woman, but as the spider Arachne. She increased before his
      eyes to an enormous size and alighted upon the pharos erected by
      Sostratus. Uninjured by the flames of the lighthouse, above which she
      hovered, she wove a net of endlessly long gray threads over the whole city
      of Alexandria, with its temples, palaces, and halls, harbours and ships,
      until Daphne suddenly appeared with a light step and quietly cut one after
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a shrill whistle aroused him. It was the signal of the
      flute-player to relieve the rowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint yellow line was now tingeing the eastern horizon of the gray,
      cloudy sky. At his left extended the flat, dull-brown coast line, which
      seemed to be lower than the turbid waves of the restless sea. The cold
      morning wind was blowing light mists over the absolutely barren shore. Not
      a tree, not a bush, not a human dwelling was to be seen in this dreary
      wilderness. Wherever the eye turned, there was nothing but sand and water,
      which united at the edge of the land. Long lines of surf poured over the
      arid desert, and, as if repelled by the desolation of this strand,
      returned to the wide sea whence they came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrill screams of the sea-gulls behind the ship, and the hoarse,
      hungry croaking of the ravens on the shore blended with the roaring of the
      waves. Hermon shuddered at this scene. Shivering, he wrapped his cloak
      closer around him, yet he did not go to the protecting cabin, but followed
      the nauarch, who pointed out to him the numerous vessels which, in a wide
      curve, surrounded the place where the Sebennytic arm of the Nile pierced
      the tongue of land to empty into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experienced seaman did not know what ships were doing there, but it
      was hardly anything good; for ravens in a countless multitude were to be
      seen on the shore and all moved toward the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippus&rsquo;s appearance on deck interrupted the nauarch. He anxiously
      showed the birds to the old hero also, and the latter&rsquo;s only reply was,
      &ldquo;Watch the helm and sails!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yonder squadron, Philippus said to the artist, was a part of his son&rsquo;s
      fleet; what brought it there was a mystery to him too.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the early meal, the galley of Eumedes approached his father&rsquo;s
      trireme. Two other galleys, not much inferior in size, were behind, and
      probably fifty smaller vessels were moving about the mouth of the Nile and
      the whole dreary tongue of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      All belonged to the royal war fleet, and the deck of every one was crowded
      with armed soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one a forest of lances bristled in the murky air, and upon its
      southward side a row of archers, each man holding his bow in his hand,
      stood shoulder to shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      At what mark were their arrows to be aimed? The men on board the Galatea
      saw it distinctly, for the shore was swarming with human figures, here
      standing crowded closely together, like horses attacked by a pack of
      wolves; yonder running, singly or in groups, toward the sea or into the
      land. Dark spots on the light sand marked the places where others had
      thrown themselves on the ground, or, kneeling, stretched out their arms as
      if in defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who were the people who populated this usually uninhabited, inhospitable
      place so densely and in so strange a manner?
    </p>
    <p>
      This could not be distinguished from the Galatea with the naked eye, but
      Philippus thought that they were the Gauls whose punishment had been
      intrusted to his son, and it soon proved that the old general was right;
      for just as the Galatea was approaching the shore, a band of twenty or
      thirty men plunged into the sea. They were Gauls. The light complexions
      and fair and red bristling hair showed this&mdash;Philippus knew them, and
      Hermon remembered the hordes of men who had rushed past him on the ride to
      Tennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the watchers were allowed only a short time for observation; brief
      shouts of command rang from the ships near them, long bows were raised in
      the air, and one after another of the light-hued forms in the water threw
      up its arms, sprang up, or sank motionless into the waves around them,
      which were dyed with a crimson stain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist shuddered; the gray-haired general covered his head with his
      cloak, and the Lady Thyone followed his example, uttering her son&rsquo;s name
      in a tone of loud lamentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nauarch pointed to the black birds in the air and close above the
      shore and the water; but the shout, &ldquo;A boat from the admiral&rsquo;s galley!&rdquo;
       soon attracted the attention of the voyagers on the Galatea in a new
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirty powerful rowers were urging the long, narrow boat toward them.
      Sometimes raised high on the crest of a mountain wave, sometimes sinking
      into the hollow, it completed its trip, and Eumedes mounted a swinging
      rope ladder to the Galatea&rsquo;s deck as nimbly as a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the young commander of the fleet hastened toward his parents. His
      mother sobbed aloud at his anything but cheerful greeting; Philippus said
      mournfully, &ldquo;I have heard nothing yet, but I know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; replied the admiral, and raising the helmet from his head,
      covered with brown curls, he added mournfully: &ldquo;First as to these men
      here. It will teach you to understand the other terrible things. Your
      Uncle Archias&rsquo;s house was destroyed; yonder men were the criminals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the capital!&rdquo; Philippus exclaimed furiously, and Hermon cried in no
      less vehement excitement: &ldquo;How did my uncle get the ill will of these
      monsters? But as the vengeance is in your hands, they will atone for this
      breach of the peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Severely, perhaps too severely,&rdquo; replied Eumedes gloomily, and Philippus
      asked his son how this evil deed could have happened, and the purport of
      the King&rsquo;s command.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admiral related what had occurred in the capital since his departure
      from Pithom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four thousand Gauls who had been sent by King Antiochus to the
      Egyptian army as auxiliary troops against Cyrene refused, before reaching
      Paraetonium, on the western frontier of the Egyptian kingdom, to obey
      their Greek commanders. As they tried to force them to continue their
      march, the barbarians left them bound in the road. They spared their
      lives, but rushed with loud shouts of exultation toward Alexandria, which
      was close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had learned that the city was almost stripped of troops, and the most
      savage instinct urged them toward the wealthy capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without encountering any resistance, they broke through the necropolis
      into Alexandria, crossed the Draco canal, and marched past the unfinished
      Temple of Serapis through the Rhakotis. At the Canopic Way they turned
      eastward and rushed through this main artery of traffic till, in the
      Brucheium, they hastened in a northerly direction toward the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      South of the Theatre of Dionysus they halted. One division turned toward
      the market-place, another toward the royal palaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until they reached the Brucheium the hordes, so eager for booty, had
      refrained from plunder and pillage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their whole strength was to be reserved, as the examination proved, for
      the attack upon the royal palaces. Several people who were thoroughly
      familiar with Alexandria had acted as guides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instigator of the mutiny was said to be a Gallic captain who had taken
      part in the surprise of Delphi, but, having ventured to punish disobedient
      soldiers, he was killed. A bridge-builder from the ranks, and his wife,
      who was not of Gallic blood, had taken his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woman, a resolute and obstinate but rarely beautiful creature, when
      the division that was to attack the royal palaces was marching past the
      house which Hermon had occupied as the heir of Myrtilus, pressed forward
      herself across the threshold, to order the mutineers who followed her to
      destroy and steal whatever came in their way. The bridge-builder went to
      the market-place, and in pillaging the wealthy merchants&rsquo; houses began
      with Archias&rsquo;s. Meanwhile it was set on fire and, with the large
      warehouses adjoining it, was burned to the foundation walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the robbers were to obtain no permanent success, either in the
      market-place or in Myrtilus&rsquo;s house, which was diagonally opposite to the
      palaestra; for General Satyrus, at the first tidings of their approach,
      had collected all the troops at his disposal and the crews of several war
      galleys, and imprisoned the division in the market-place as though in a
      mouse-trap. The bands to which the woman belonged were forced by the
      cavalry into the palaestra and the neighbouring Maander, and kept there
      until Eumedes brought re-enforcements and compelled the Gauls to
      surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King sent from Memphis the order to take the vanquished men to the
      tongue of land where they now were, and could easily be imprisoned between
      the sea and the Sebennytic inland lake. They were guilty of death to the
      last man, and starvation was to perform the executioner&rsquo;s office upon
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, Eumedes, the admiral concluded, was in the King&rsquo;s service, and must do
      what his commander in chief ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duty,&rdquo; sighed Philippus; &ldquo;yet what a punishment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand to his son as he spoke, but the Lady Thyone shook her
      head mournfully, saying: &ldquo;There are four thousand over yonder; and the
      philosopher and historian on the throne, the admirable art critic who
      bestows upon his capital and Egypt all the gifts of peace, who understands
      how to guard and develop it better than any one else&mdash;yet what
      influence the gloomy powers exert upon him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she hesitated, and went on in a low whisper: &ldquo;The blood of two
      brothers stains his hand and his conscience. The oldest, to whom the
      throne would have belonged, he exiled. And our friend, Demetrius
      Phalereus, his father&rsquo;s noble councillor! Because you, Philippus,
      interceded for him&mdash;though you were in a position of command, because
      Ptolemy knows your ability&mdash;you were sent to distant Pelusium, and
      there we should be still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guard your tongue, wife!&rdquo; interrupted the old general in a tone of grave
      rebuke. &ldquo;The vipers on the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt symbolize the
      King&rsquo;s swift power over life and death. To the Egyptians the Philadelphi,
      Ptolemy and Arsinoe, are gods, and what cause have we to reproach them
      except that they use their omnipotence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, mother,&rdquo; Eumedes eagerly added, &ldquo;do not the royal pair on the throne
      merely follow the example of far greater ones among the immortal gods?
      When the very Gauls who are devoted to death yonder, greedy for booty,
      attacked Delphi, four years ago, it was the august brother and sister,
      Apollo and Artemis, who sent them to Hades with their arrows, while Zeus
      hurled his thunderbolts at them and ordered heavy boulders to fall upon
      them from the shaken mountains. Many of the men over there fled from
      destruction at Delphi. Unconverted, they added new crimes to the old ones,
      but now retribution will overtake them. The worse the crime, the more
      bloody the vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the last must die, as my sovereign commands; only I shall determine
      the mode of death according to my own judgment, and at the same time,
      mother, feel sure of your approval. Instead of lingering starvation, I
      shall use swift arrows. Now you know what you were obliged to learn. It
      would be wise, mother, for you to leave this abode of misery. Duty summons
      me to my ship.&rdquo; He held out his hand to his parents and Hermon as he
      spoke, but the latter clasped it firmly, exclaiming in a tone of
      passionate emotion, &ldquo;What is the name of the woman to whom, though she is
      not of their race, the lawless barbarians yielded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ledscha,&rdquo; replied the admiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon started as if stung by a scorpion, and asked, &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my ship,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;if she has not yet been taken ashore with
      the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be killed with the pitiable band there?&rdquo; cried Thyone angrily, looking
      her son reproachfully in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; replied Eumedes. &ldquo;She will be taken to the others under the
      escort of trustworthy men in order, perhaps, to induce her to speak. It
      must be ascertained whether there were accomplices in the attack on the
      royal palaces, and lastly whence the woman comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you that myself,&rdquo; replied Hermon. &ldquo;Allow me to accompany you.
      I must see and speak to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Arachne of Tennis?&rdquo; asked Thyone. Hermon&rsquo;s mute nod of assent
      answered the question, but she exclaimed: &ldquo;The unhappy woman, who called
      down the wrath of Nemesis upon you, and who has now herself fallen a prey
      to the avenging goddess. What do you want from her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon bent down to his old friend and whispered, &ldquo;To lighten her terrible
      fate, if it is in my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, then,&rdquo; replied the matron, and turned to her son, saying, &ldquo;Let Hermon
      tell you how deeply this woman has influenced his life, and, when her turn
      comes, think of your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a woman,&rdquo; replied Eumedes, &ldquo;and the King&rsquo;s mandate only commands
      me to punish men. Besides, I promised her indulgence if she would make a
      confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she?&rdquo; asked Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither by threats nor promises,&rdquo; answered the admiral, &ldquo;can this
      sinister, beautiful creature be induced to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said the artist, and a smile of satisfaction flitted over
      his face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A short row took Hermon and Eumedes the admiral&rsquo;s galley. Ledscha had
      already been carried ashore. There she was to be confronted with the men
      who were suspected of having showed the mutineers the way to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in his own thoughts, Hermon waited for the admiral, who at first
      was claimed by one official duty after another. The artist&rsquo;s thoughts
      lingered with Daphne. To her father the loss of his house, nay, perhaps of
      his wealth, would seem almost unendurable, yet even were he beggared,
      provision was made for him and his daughter. He, Hermon, could again
      create, as in former days, and what happiness it would be if he were
      permitted to repay the man to whom he owed so much for the kindness
      bestowed upon him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed to give to the woman he loved again and again, and it would have
      seemed to him a favour of fortune if the flames had consumed even the last
      drachm of her wealthy father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Completely engrossed by these reflections, he forgot the horrors before
      him, but when he raised his eyes and saw the archers continuing their
      terrible work he shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admiral&rsquo;s galley lay so near the shore that he distinguished the
      figures of the Gauls separately. Some, obeying the instinct of self
      preservation, fled from the places which could be reached by the arrows of
      the archers on the ships, but others pressed toward the shafts. A
      frightful, heart-rending spectacle, yet how rich in food for the
      long-darkened eyes of the artist! Two brothers of unusual height, who,
      nude like all their comrades in death, offered their broad, beautifully
      arched chests to the arrows, would not leave his memory. It was a terrible
      sight, yet grand and worthy of being wrested from oblivion by art, and it
      impressed itself firmly on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      After noon Eumedes could at last devote himself to his young friend.
      Although the wind drove showers of fine rain before it, the admiral
      remained on deck with the sculptor. What cared they for the inclement
      weather, while one was recalling to mind and telling his friend how the
      hate of an offended woman had unchained the gloomy spirits of revenge upon
      him, the other, who had defied death on land water, listened to his story,
      sometimes in surprise, sometimes with silent horror?
    </p>
    <p>
      After the examination to which she had been subjected, Eumedes had
      believed Ledscha to be as Hermon described her. He found nothing petty in
      this beautiful, passionate creature who avenged the injustice inflicted
      upon her as Fate took vengeance, who, with unsparing energy, anticipated
      the Nemesis to whom she appealed, compelled men&rsquo;s obedience, and instead
      of enriching herself cast away the talents extorted to bring down fresh
      ruin upon the man who had transformed her love to hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the friends consulted together with lowered voices, their conjecture
      became conviction that it was the Biamite&rsquo;s inextinguishable hate which
      had led her to the Gauls and induced her to share the attack upon the
      capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assault upon the houses of Archias and Myrtilus was a proof of this,
      for the latter was still believed to be Hermon&rsquo;s property. She had
      probably supposed that the merchant&rsquo;s palace sheltered Daphne, in whom,
      even at Tennis, she had seen and hated her successful rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the undeniable fact that Ledscha was the bridge-builder&rsquo;s companion
      presented an enigma difficult to solve. The freedman Bias had remained on
      Philippus&rsquo;s galley, and could not now be appealed to for a confirmation of
      his assertions, but Hermon distinctly remembered his statement that
      Ledscha had allowed the Gaul, after he had received the money intended for
      him, to take her from Pitane to Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the short November day was drawing to a close, and the friends had
      strengthened themselves with food and drink, the rain ceased and, as the
      sun set, its after-glow broke through the rifts and fissures in the black
      wall of clouds in the western horizon like blazing flames in the
      conflagration of a solid stone building. Yet the glow vanished swiftly
      enough. The darkness of night spread over the sea and the arid strip of
      land in the south, but the greedy croaking of the ravens and vultures
      echoed more and more loudly from the upper air. From time to time the
      outbursts of rage and agony of despairing men, and horrible jeering
      laughter, drowned the voices of the flocks of birds and the roaring of the
      tempestuous sea. Sometimes, too, a sharp word of command, or a signal
      heard for a long distance, pierced through the awful sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there, and at last everywhere on the squadron, which surrounded
      the tongue of land in a shallow curve, dim lights began to appear on the
      masts and prows of the ships; but darkness brooded over the coast. Only in
      the three fortified guardhouses, which had been hastily erected here, the
      feeble light of a lantern illumined the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twinkling lights also appeared in the night heavens between the swiftly
      flying clouds. One star after another began to adorn the blue islands in
      the cloudy firmament, and at last the full moon burst through the heavy
      banks of dark clouds, and shone in pure brilliancy above their heads, like
      a huge silver vessel in the black catafalque of a giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the first hour after sunset Eumedes ordered the boat to be
      manned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed as if for battle, he prepared for the row to the scene of misery,
      and requested Hermon to buckle a coat of mail under his chlamys and put on
      the sword he gave him. True, a division of reliable Macedonian warriors
      was to accompany them, and Ledscha was in a well-guarded place, yet it
      might perhaps be necessary to defend themselves against an outburst of
      despair among the condemned prisoners. On the short trip, the crests of
      the tossing waves sometimes shone with a flickering light, while elsewhere
      long shadows spread like dark sails over the sea. The flat coast on which
      both men soon stepped was brightly illumined by the moonbeams, and the
      forms of the doomed men stood forth, like the black figures on the red
      background of a vase, upon the yellowish-brown sand on which they were
      standing, running, walking, or lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the western end of the tongue of land a sand hill had been surrounded
      by a wall and moat, guarded by heavily armed soldiers and several archers.
      The level ground below had been made secure against any attack, and on the
      right side was a roof supported by pillars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officials intrusted with the examination of the ringleaders had
      remained during the day in this hastily erected open hut. The latter,
      bound to posts, awaited their sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only woman among them was Ledscha, who crouched, unfettered, on the
      ground behind the enclosure, which consisted of short stakes fastened by a
      rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without presenting any serious obstacle, it merely indicated how far the
      prisoners might venture to go. Whoever crossed it must expect to be struck
      down by an arrow from the wall. This earthwork, it is true, menaced those
      held captive here, but they also owed it a debt of gratitude, for it shut
      from their eyes the horrible incidents on the sandy plain between the sea
      and the inland lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spot was now made as light as day by the rays of the full moon which
      floated in the pure azure sky far above the black cloud mountains, like a
      white lotus flower on clear waters, and poured floods of silvery radiance
      upon the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eumedes commanded the Macedonians who formed his escort to remain at the
      fortress on the dune, and, pointing out Ledscha by a wave of the hand, he
      whispered to Hermon: &ldquo;By the girdle of Aphrodite! she is terribly
      beautiful! For whom is the Medea probably brewing in imagination the
      poisoned draught?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave the sculptor permission to promise her immunity from
      punishment if she would consent at least to explain the Gauls&rsquo; connection
      with the royal palaces; but Hermon strenuously refused to undertake this
      or a similar commission to Ledscha.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eumedes had expected the denial, and merely expressed to his friend his
      desire to speak to the Biamite after his interview was over. However
      refractory she might be, his mother&rsquo;s intercession should benefit her.
      Hermon might assure her that he, the commander, meant to deal leniently.
      He pressed the artist&rsquo;s hand as he spoke, and walked rapidly away to
      ascertain the condition of affairs in the other guardhouses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had the brave artist&rsquo;s heart throbbed faster in any danger than on
      the eve of this meeting; but it was no longer love that thrilled it so
      passionately, far less hate or the desire to let his foe feel that her
      revenge was baffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy for the victor to exercise magnanimity, and easiest of all for
      the sculptor in the presence of so beautiful an enemy, and Hermon thought
      he had never seen the Biamite look fairer. How exquisitely rounded was the
      oval, how delicately cut the profile of her face, how large were the
      widely separated, sparkling eyes, above which, even in the pale moonlight,
      the thick black brows were visible, united under the forehead as if for a
      dark deed to be performed in common!
    </p>
    <p>
      Time had rather enhanced than lessened the spell of this wonderful young
      creature. Now she rose from the ground where she had been crouching and
      paced several times up and down the short path at her disposal; but she
      started suddenly, for one of the Gauls bound to the posts, in whom Hermon
      recognised the bridge-builder, Lutarius, called her name, and when she
      turned her face toward him, panted in broken Greek like one overwhelmed by
      despair: &ldquo;Once more&mdash;it shall be the last time&mdash;I beseech you!
      Lay your hand upon my brow, and if that is too much, speak but one kind
      word to me before all is over! I only want to hear that you do not hate me
      like a foe and despise me like a dog. What can it cost you? You need only
      tell me in two words that you are sorry for your harshness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same fate awaits us both,&rdquo; cried Ledscha curtly and firmly. &ldquo;Let each
      take care of himself. When my turn comes and my eyes grow dim in death, I
      will thank them that they will not show you to me again, base wretch,
      throughout eternity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lutarius shrieked aloud in savage fury, and tore so frantically at the
      strong ropes which bound him that the firm posts shook, but Ledscha turned
      away and approached the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned thoughtfully against one of the pillars that supported the
      roof, and the artist&rsquo;s eyes watched her intently; every movement seemed to
      him noble and worth remembering.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her hand shading her brow, she gazed upward to the full moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermon had already delayed speaking to her too long, but he would have
      deemed it criminal to startle her from this attitude. So must Arachne have
      stood when the goddess, in unjust anger, raised the weaver&rsquo;s shuttle
      against the more skilful mortal; for while Ledscha&rsquo;s brow frowned angrily,
      a triumphant smile hovered around her mouth. At the same time she slightly
      opened her exquisitely formed lips, and the little white teeth which
      Hermon had once thought so bewitchingly beautiful glittered between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the astronomer who fixes his gaze and tries to imprint upon his
      memory some rare star in the firmament which a cloud is threatening to
      obscure, he now strove to obtain Ledscha&rsquo;s image. He would and could model
      her in this attitude, exactly as she stood there, without her veil, which
      had been torn from her during the hand-to-hand conflict when she was
      captured, with her thick, half-loosened tresses falling over her left
      shoulder; nav, even with the slightly hooked nose, which was opposed to
      the old rule of art that permitted only the straight bridge of the nose to
      be given to beautiful women. Her nature harmonized with the ideal even in
      the smallest detail; here any deviation from reality must tend to injure
      the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained motionless for minutes in the same attitude, as if she knew
      that she was posing to an artist; but Hermon gazed at her as if spell
      bound till the fettered Gaul again called her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she left the supporting pillar, approached the barrier, stopped at
      the rope which extended from one short stake to another, and gazed at the
      man who was following her outside of the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Greek who stood directly opposite to her. A black beard adorned
      his grave, handsome countenance. He, too, had a chlamys, such as she had
      formerly seen on another. Only the short sword, which he wore suspended at
      his right side in the Hellenic fashion, would not suit that other; but
      suddenly a rush of hot blood crimsoned her face. As if to save herself
      from falling, she flung out both arms and clutched a stake with her right
      and her left hand, thrusting her head and the upper portion of her body
      across the rope toward the man whose appearance had created so wild a
      tumult in her whole being.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she called Hermon&rsquo;s name in such keen suspense that it fell upon
      his ear like a shrill cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ledscha,&rdquo; he answered warmly, extending both hands to her in sincere
      sympathy; but she did not heed the movement, and her tone of calm
      self-satisfaction surprised him as she answered: &ldquo;So you seek me in
      misfortune? Even the blind man knows how to find me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would far rather have met you again in the greatest happiness!&rdquo; he
      interrupted gently. &ldquo;But I am no longer blind. The immortals again permit
      me, as in former days, to feast my eyes upon your marvellous beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shrill laugh cut short his words, and the &ldquo;Not blind!&rdquo; which fell again
      and again from her lips sounded more like laughter than speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are tears of grief and of joy, and the laugh which is an
      accompaniment of pleasure is also heard on the narrow boundary between
      suffering and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pierced the artist&rsquo;s heart more deeply than the most savage outburst of
      fury, and when Ledscha gasped: &ldquo;Not blind! Cured! Rich and possessed of
      sight, perfect sight!&rdquo; he understood her fully for the first time, and
      could account for the smile of satisfaction which had just surprised him
      on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her, absolutely unable to utter a word; but she went on
      speaking, while a low, sinister laugh mingled with her tones: &ldquo;So this is
      avenging justice! It allows us women to be trampled under foot, and holds
      its hands in its lap! My vengeance! How I have lauded Nemesis! How
      exquisitely my retaliation seemed to have succeeded! And now? It was mere
      delusion and deception. He who was blind sees. He who was to perish in
      misery is permitted, with a sword at his side, to gloat over our
      destruction. Listen, if the good news has not already reached you! I, too,
      am condemned to death. But what do I care for myself? Even less than those
      to whom we pray and offer sacrifices for the betrayed woman. Now I am
      learning to know them! Thus Nemesis thanks me for the lavish gifts I have
      bestowed upon her? Just before my end she throws you, the rewarded
      traitor, into my way! I must submit to have the hated foe, whose blinding
      was the sole pleasure in my ruined life, look me in the face with insolent
      joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hermon&rsquo;s quick blood boiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      With fierce resentment he grasped her hand, which lay on the rope, pressed
      it violently in his strong clasp, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Stop, mad woman, that I
      may not be forced to think of you as a poisonous serpent and repulsive
      spider!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha had vainly endeavoured to withdraw her hand while he was speaking.
      Now he himself released it; but she looked up at him in bewilderment, as
      if seeking aid, and said sadly: &ldquo;Once&mdash;you know that yourself&mdash;I
      was different&mdash;even as long as I supposed my vengeance had succeeded.
      But now? The false goddess has baffled every means with which I sought to
      punish you. Who averted the sorest ill treatment from my head? And I was
      even defrauded of the revenge which it was my right, nay, my duty, to
      exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She finished the sentence with drooping head, as if utterly crushed, and
      this time she did not laugh, but Hermon felt his wrath transformed to
      sympathy, and he asked warmly and kindly if she would let nothing appease
      her, not even if he begged her forgiveness for the wrong he had done her,
      and promised to obtain her life, nay, also her liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha shook her head gently, and gravely answered: &ldquo;What is left me
      without hate? What are the things which others deem best and highest to a
      miserable wretch like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Hermon pointed to the bridge-builder, bound to the post, saying,
      &ldquo;Yonder man led you away from the husband whom you had wedded, and from
      him you received compensation for the love you had lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From him?&rdquo; she cried furiously, and, raising her voice in a tone of the
      most intense loathing: &ldquo;Ask yonder scoundrel himself! Because I needed a
      guide, I permitted him to take me away from my unloved husband and from
      the Hydra. Because he would help me to shatter the new and undeserved good
      fortune which you&mdash;yes, you&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;enjoyed, I
      remained with him among the Gauls. More than one Alexandrian brought me
      the news that you were revelling in golden wealth, and the wretch promised
      to make you and your uncle beggars if the surprise succeeded. He did this,
      though he knew that it was you who took him up from the road and saved his
      life; for nothing good and noble dwells in his knavish soul. He yearned
      for me, and still more ardently for the Alexandrians&rsquo; gold. Worse than the
      wolf that licked the hand of the man who bandaged its wounds, he would
      have shown his teeth to the preserver of his life. I have learned this,
      and if he dies here of starvation and thirst he will receive only what he
      deserves. He knows, too, what I think of him. The greedy beast of prey was
      not permitted even to touch my hand. Just ask him! There he is. Let him
      tell you how I listened to his vows of love. Before I would have permitted
      yonder wretch to recall to life what you crushed in this heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Lutarius interrupted her with a flood of savage, scarcely
      intelligible curses, but very soon one of the guards, who came out of the
      hut, stopped him with a lash.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Gaul, howling under the blows, was silenced, Hermon asked, &ldquo;So
      your mad thirst for vengeance also caused this suicidal attack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered simply; &ldquo;but when they determined upon the assault, and
      had killed their leader, Belgius, yonder monster stole to their head. So
      it happened&mdash;I myself do not know how&mdash;that they also obeyed me,
      and I took advantage of it and induced them to begin with your house and
      Archias&rsquo;s. When they had captured the royal palaces, they intended to
      assail the Temple of Demeter also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you thought that even the terrible affliction of blindness would not
      suffice to punish the man you hated?&rdquo; asked Hermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered firmly; &ldquo;for you could buy with your gold everything
      life offers except sight, while in me&mdash;yes, in me&mdash;gloom darker
      than the blackest night shrouded my soul. Through your fault I was robbed
      of all, all that is clear to woman&rsquo;s heart: my father&rsquo;s house, his love,
      my sister. Even the pleasure in myself which had been awakened by your
      sweet flatteries was transformed by you into loathing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By me?&rdquo; cried Hermon, amazed by the injustice of this severe reproach;
      but Ledscha answered his question with the resolute assertion, &ldquo;By you and
      you alone!&rdquo; and then impatiently added: &ldquo;You, who, by your art, could
      transform mortal women into goddesses, wished to make me a humiliated
      creature, with the rope which was to strangle her about her neck, and at
      the same time the most repulsive of creeping insects. &lsquo;The hideous, gray,
      eight-legged spider!&rsquo; I exclaimed to myself, when I raised my arms and saw
      my shadow on the sunlit ground. &lsquo;The spider!&rsquo; I thought, when I shook the
      distaff to draw threads from the flax in leisure hours. &lsquo;Your image!&rsquo; I
      said, when I saw spiders hanging in dusty corners, and catching flies and
      gnats. All these things made me a horror to myself. And at the same time
      to know that the Demeter, on whom you bestowed the features of the
      daughter of Archias, was kindling the whole great city of Alexandria with
      enthusiasm, and drawing countless worshippers to her sanctuary! She, an
      object of adoration to thousands, I&mdash;the much-praised beauty&mdash;a
      horror to myself! This is what fed my desire for vengeance with fresh food
      by day and night; this urged me to remain with yonder wretch; for he had
      promised, after pillaging the royal palaces, to shatter your Demeter, the
      image of the daughter of Archias, which they lauded and which brought you
      fame and honour&mdash;it was to be done before my eyes&mdash;into
      fragments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad woman!&rdquo; Hermon again broke forth indignantly, and hastily told her
      how she had been misinformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha&rsquo;s large black eyes dilated as if some hideous spectre was rising
      from the ground before her, while she heard that the Demeter was the work
      of Myrtilus and not his; that his friend&rsquo;s legacy had long since ceased to
      belong to him, and that he was again as poor as when he was in Tennis
      during the time of their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the blindness?&rdquo; she asked sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It transformed life for me into one long night, illumined by no single
      ray of light,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but, the immortals be praised, I was cured
      of it, and it was old Tabus, on the Owl&rsquo;s Nest at Tennis, whose wisdom and
      magic arts you so often lauded, who gave the remedy and advice to which I
      owe my recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he hesitated, for Ledscha had seized the rope with one hand and the
      stake at her right with the other, in order not to fall upon her knees;
      but Hermon perceived how terribly his words agitated her, and spoke to her
      soothingly. Ledscha did not seem to hear him, for while still clinging to
      the rope she looked sometimes at the sand at her feet, sometimes up to the
      full moon, which was now flooding both sky and earth with light.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she dropped it, and said in a hollow tone: &ldquo;Now I understand
      everything. You met her when Bias gave her the bridal dowry which was to
      purchase my release from my husband. How it must have enraged her! I
      thought of it all, pondered and pondered how to spare her; but through
      whom, except Tabus, could I return to Hanno the property, won in battle by
      his blood, which he had thrown away for me? Tabus kept the family wealth.
      And she&mdash;the marriage bond which two persons formed was sacred and
      unassailable&mdash;the woman who broke her faith with her husband and
      turned from him&mdash;was an abomination to her. How she loved her sons
      and grandsons! I knew that she would never forgive the wrong I did Hanno.
      From resentment to me she cured the man whom I hated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet probably also,&rdquo; said Hermon, &ldquo;because my blighted youth aroused her
      pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; replied Ledscha hesitatingly, gazing thoughtfully into
      vacancy. &ldquo;She was what her demons made her. Hard as steel and gentle as a
      tender girl. I have experienced it. Oh, that she should die with rancour
      against me in her faithful old heart! She could be so kind!&mdash;even
      when I confessed that you had won my love, she still held me dear. But
      there are many great and small demons, and most of them were probably
      subject to her. Tabus must have learned through them how deeply I offended
      her son Satabus, and how greatly his son Hanno&rsquo;s life was darkened through
      me. That is why she thwarted my vengeance, and her spirits aided her. Thus
      all these things happened. I suspected it when I heard that she had
      succumbed to death, which I&mdash;yes, I here&mdash;had held back from her
      with severe toil through many a sleepless night. O these demons! They will
      continue to act in the service of the dead. Wherever I may go, they will
      pursue me and, at their mistress&rsquo;s bidding, baffle what I hope and desire.
      I have learned this only too distinctly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Ledscha, no,&rdquo; Hermon protested. &ldquo;Every power ceases with death, even
      that of the sorceress over spirits. You shall be freed, poor woman! You
      will be permitted to go wherever you desire; and I shall model no spider
      after your person, but the fairest of women. Thousands will see and admire
      her, and&mdash;if the Muse aids me&mdash;whoever, enraptured by her
      beauty, asks, &lsquo;Who was the model for this work which inflames the most
      obdurate heart?&rsquo; will be told, &lsquo;It was Ledscha, the daughter of Shalit,
      the Biamite, whom Hermon of Alexandria found worthy of carving in costly
      marble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ledscha uttered a deep sigh of relief, and asked: &ldquo;Is that true? May I
      believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As true,&rdquo; he answered warmly, &ldquo;as that Selene, who promised to grant you
      in her full radiance the greatest happiness, is now shedding her mild,
      forgiving light upon us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The full moon,&rdquo; she murmured softly, gazing upward at the shining disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she added in a louder tone: &ldquo;Old Tabus&rsquo;s demons promised me happiness&mdash;you
      know. It was the spider which so cruelly shadowed it for me on every full
      moon, every day, and every night. Will you now swear to model a statue
      from me, the statue of a beautiful human being that will arouse the
      delight of all who see it? Delight&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;not loathing&mdash;I
      ask again, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, and I shall succeed,&rdquo; he said earnestly, holding out his hand
      across the rope. She clasped it, looked up to the full moon again, and
      whispered: &ldquo;This time&mdash;I will believe it&mdash;you will keep your
      promise better than when you were in Tennis. And I&mdash;I will cease to
      wish you evil, and I will tell you why. Bend your ear nearer, that I may
      confess it openly.&rdquo; Hermon willingly obeyed the request, but she leaned
      her head against his, and he felt her laboured breathing and the warm
      tears that coursed silently down her cheeks as she said, in a low whisper:
      &ldquo;Because the moon is full, and will yet bring me what the demons promised,
      and because, though strong, I am still a woman. Happiness! How long ago I
      ceased to expect it!&mdash;but now-yes, it is what I now feel! I am happy,
      and yet can not tell why. My love&mdash;oh, yes! It was more ardent than
      the burning hate. Now you know it, too, Hermon. And I&mdash;I shall be
      free, you say? And Tabus, how she lauded rest&mdash;eternal rest! Oh
      dearest&mdash;this sorely tortured heart, too&mdash;you can not even
      imagine how weary I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she was silent, but the man into whose face she was gazing with
      loving devotion felt a sudden movement at his side as she uttered the
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not notice it, for the sweet tone of her voice was penetrating the
      inmost depths of his heart. It sounded as though she was speaking from the
      happiest of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ledscha!&rdquo; he exclaimed warmly, extending his arm toward her&mdash;but she
      had already stepped back from his side, and he now perceived the terrible
      object&mdash;she had snatched his sword from its sheath, and as, seized by
      sudden terror, he gazed at her, he saw the shining blade glitter in the
      moonlight and suddenly vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant he swung his agile body over the rope and rushed to her. But
      she had already sunk to her knees, and while he clasped her in is arms to
      support her, he heard her call his own name tenderly, then murmur it in a
      lower tone, and the words &ldquo;Full moon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Happiness&rdquo; escape her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was silent, and her beautiful head dropped on her breast like a
      flower broken by a tempest.

      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was best so for her and for us,&rdquo; said Eumedes, after gazing long at
      Ledscha&rsquo;s touchingly beautiful, still, dead face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he ordered her to be buried at once and shouted to the guards:
      &ldquo;Everything must be over on this strip of land early to-morrow morning!
      Let all who bear arms begin at once. Selene will light the men brightly
      enough for the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The terrible order given in mercy was fulfilled, and hunger and thirst
      were robbed of their numerous prey. When the new day dawned the friends
      were still on deck, engaged in grave conversation. The cloudless sky now
      arched in radiant light above the azure sea. White seagulls came flying
      from the right across the ship, and sportive dolphins gambolled around her
      keel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flutes of the musicians, marking time for the rowers, echoed gaily up
      from the hold, and, obedient to quick words of command, the seamen were
      spreading the sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyage began with a favourable wind. As Hermon looked back for the
      last time, the flat, desolate tongue of land appeared like a line of gray
      mist in the southeastern horizon; but over it hovered, like a gloomy
      thundercloud, the flocks of vultures and ravens, whose numbers were
      constantly increasing. Their greedy screaming could still be heard, though
      but faintly, yet the eye could no longer distinguish anything in the
      fast-vanishing abode of horror, save the hovering whirl of dark spots&mdash;ravens
      and vultures, vultures and ravens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever human life had moved there yesterday, now rested from bloody
      greed for booty, after victory and defeat, mortal terror, fury, and
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eumedes pointed out the quiet grave by the sea to his parents, saying:
      &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s command is fulfilled. Not even the one man who is usually
      spared to carry the news remains out of the four thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; exclaimed Alexander&rsquo;s gray-haired comrade, shaking his
      son&rsquo;s right hand, but Thyone laid her hand on Hermon&rsquo;s arm, saving: &ldquo;Where
      the birds are darkening the air behind us lies buried what incensed
      Nemesis against you. You must leave the soil of Egypt. True, it is said
      that to live in foreign lands, far from the beloved home, darkens the
      existence; yet Pergamus, too, is Grecian soil, and there I see the two
      noblest of stars illumine your path with their pure light-art and love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And his old friend&rsquo;s premonition was fulfilled.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         .......................

    <p>
      The story of Arachne is ended. It closed on the Nile. Hermon&rsquo;s new life
      began in Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Daphne&rsquo;s husband, under the same roof with the wonderfully invigorated
      Myrtilus, his Uncle Archias, and faithful Bias, Hermon found in the new
      home what had hovered before the blind man as the fairest goal of
      existence in art, love, and friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not long miss the gay varied life of Alexandria, because he found a
      rich compensation for it, and because Pergamus, too, was a rapidly growing
      city, whose artistic decoration was inferior to no other in Greece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the numerous works which Hermon completed in the service of the first
      three art-loving rulers of the new Pergamenian kingdom, Philetaerus,
      Eumenes, and Attalus, nothing was preserved except the head of a Gaul.
      This noble masterpiece proves how faithful Hermon remained to truth, which
      he had early chosen for the guiding star of his art. It is the modest
      remnant of the group in which Hermon perpetuated in marble the two Gallic
      brothers whom he saw before his last meeting with Ledscha, as they offered
      their breasts to the fatal shafts.
    </p>
    <p>
      One had gazed defiantly at the arrows of the conquerors; the other, whose
      head has been preserved, feeling the inevitable approach of death,
      anticipates, with sorrowful emotion, the end so close at hand. Philetaerus
      had sent this touching work to King Ptolemy to thank him for the severity
      with which he had chastised the daring of the barbarians, who had not
      spared his kingdom also. The Gaul&rsquo;s head was again found on Egyptian soil.
    </p>

   Ghizeh in Cairo. Leipsic, 1896. With appendix. By H. Curschmann.]
</pre>
    <p>
      Hermon also took other subjects in Pergamus from the domain of real life,
      though, in most of his work he crossed the limits which he had formerly
      imposed upon himself. But one barrier, often as he rushed forward to its
      outermost verge, he never dared to pass&mdash;moderation, the noblest
      demand, to which his liberty-loving race subjected themselves willingly in
      life as well as in art. The whole infinite, limitless world of the ideal
      had opened itself to the blind man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made himself at home in it by remaining faithful to the rule which he
      had found in the desert for his creative work, and the genuine happiness
      which he enjoyed through Daphne&rsquo;s love and the great fame his sculptures
      brought him increased the strong individuality of his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fruits of his tireless industry, the much-admired god of light,
      Phoebus Apollo, slaying the dragons of darkness, as well as his bewitching
      Arachne, gazing proudly at the fabric with which she thinks she has
      surpassed the skill of the goddess, were overtaken by destruction. In this
      statue Bias recognised his countrywoman Ledscha, and often gazed long at
      it with devout ecstasy. Even Hermon&rsquo;s works of colossal size vanished from
      the earth: the Battle of the Amazons and the relief containing numerous
      figures: the Sea Gods, which the Regent Eumenes ordered for the Temple of
      Poseidon in Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The works of his grandson and grandson&rsquo;s pupils, however, are preserved on
      the great altar of victory in Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power and energy natural to Hermon, the skill he had acquired in
      Rhodes, everything in the changeful life of Alexandria which had induced
      him to consecrate his art to reality, and to that alone, and whatever he
      had, finally, in quiet seclusion, recognised as right and in harmony with
      the Greek nature and his own, blend in those works of his successor, which
      a gracious dispensation of Providence permits us still to admire at the
      present day, and which we call in its entirety, the art of Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city was a second beloved home to him, as well as to his wife and
      Myrtilus. The rulers of the country took the old Alexandrian Archias into
      their confidence and knew how to honour him by many a distinction. He
      understood how to value the happiness of his only daughter, the beautiful
      development of his grandchildren, and the high place that Hermon and
      Myrtilus, whom he loved as if they were his own sons, attained among the
      artists of their time. Yet he struggled vainly against the longing for his
      dear old home. Therefore Hermon deemed it one of the best days of his life
      when his turn came to make Daphne&rsquo;s father a happy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Ptolemy Philadelphus had sent laurel to the artist who had fallen
      under suspicion in Egypt, and his messenger invited him and Myrtilus, and
      with them also the exiled merchant, to return to his presence. In
      gratitude for the pleasure which Hermon&rsquo;s creation afforded him and his
      wife, the cause that kept the fugitive Archias from his home should be
      forgiven and forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray-haired son of the capital returned with the Bithynian Gras to his
      beloved Alexandria, as if his lost youth was again restored. There he
      found unchanged the busy, active life, the Macedonian Council, the bath,
      the marketplace, the bewitching conversation, the biting wit, the
      exquisite feasts of the eyes&mdash;in short, everything for which his
      heart had longed even amid the happiness and love of his dear ones in
      Pergamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two years he endeavoured to enjoy everything as before; but when the
      works of the Pergamenian artists, obtained by Ptolemy, had been exhibited
      in the royal palaces, he returned home with a troubled mind. Like the rest
      of the world, he thought that the reliefs of Myrtilus, representing scenes
      of rural life, were wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capture of Proserpina, a life-size marble group by his son-in-law
      Hermon, seemed to him no less perfect; but it exerted a peculiar influence
      upon his paternal heart, for, in the Demeter, he recognised Daphne, in the
      Proserpina her oldest daughter Erigone, who bore the name of Hermon&rsquo;s
      mother and resembled her in womanly charm. How lovely this budding girl,
      who was his grand-daughter, seemed to the grandfather! How graceful, in
      spite of the womanly dignity peculiar to her, was the mother, encircling
      her imperilled child with her protecting arm!
    </p>
    <p>
      No work of sculpture had ever produced such an effect upon the old patron
      of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gras heard him, in his bedroom, murmur the names &ldquo;Daphne&rdquo; and &ldquo;Erigone,&rdquo;
       and therefore it did not surprise him when, the next morning, he received
      the command to prepare everything for the return to Pergamus. It pleased
      the Bithynian, for he cared more for Daphne, Hermon, and their children
      than all the pleasures of the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks later Archias found himself again in Pergamus with his family,
      and he never left it, though he reached extreme old age, and was even
      permitted to gaze in wondering admiration at the first attempts of the
      oldest son of Hermon and Daphne, and to hear them praised by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      This grandson of the Alexandrian Archias afterward became the master who
      taught the generation of artists who created the Pergamenian works, in
      examining which the question forced itself upon the narrator of this
      story: How do these sculptures possess the qualities which distinguish
      them so strongly from the other statues of later Hellenic antiquity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did the great weaver Imagination err when she blended them, through the
      mighty wrestler Hermon, with a tendency of Alexandrian science and art,
      which we see appearing again among us children of a period so much later?
    </p>
    <p>
      Science, which is now once more pursuing similar paths, ought and will
      follow them further, but Hermon&rsquo;s words remain applicable to the present
      clay: &ldquo;We will remain loyal servants of the truth; yet it alone does not
      hold the key to the holy of holies of art. To him for whom Apollo, the
      pure among the gods, and the Muses, friends of beauty, do not open it at
      the same time with truth, its gates will remain closed, no matter how
      strongly and persistently he shakes them.&rdquo;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
